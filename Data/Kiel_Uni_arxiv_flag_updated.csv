0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Asymptotics of Empirical Eigen-structure for Ultra-high Dimensional   Spiked Covariance Model,2015,"  We derive the asymptotic distributions of the spiked eigenvalues and eigenvectors under a generalized and unified asymptotic regime, which takes into account the spike magnitude of leading eigenvalues, sample size, and dimensionality. This new regime allows high dimensionality and diverging eigenvalue spikes and provides new insights into the roles the leading eigenvalues, sample size, and dimensionality play in principal component analysis. The results are proven by a technical device, which swaps the role of rows and columns and converts the high-dimensional problems into low-dimensional ones. Our results are a natural extension of those in Paul (2007) to more general setting with new insights and solve the rates of convergence problems in Shen et al. (2013). They also reveal the biases of the estimation of leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors by using principal component analysis, and lead to a new covariance estimator for the approximate factor model, called shrinkage principal orthogonal complement thresholding (S-POET), that corrects the biases. Our results are successfully applied to outstanding problems in estimation of risks of large portfolios and false discovery proportions for dependent test statistics and are illustrated by simulation studies.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Large Covariance Estimation through Elliptical Factor Models,2015,"  We proposed a general Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) framework for large-scale covariance matrix estimation based on an approximate factor model. A set of high level sufficient conditions for the procedure to achieve optimal rates of convergence under different matrix norms were brought up to better understand how POET works. Such a framework allows us to recover the results for sub-Gaussian in a more transparent way that only depends on the concentration properties of the sample covariance matrix. As a new theoretical contribution, for the first time, such a framework allows us to exploit conditional sparsity covariance structure for the heavy-tailed data. In particular, for the elliptical data, we proposed a robust estimator based on marginal and multivariate Kendall's tau to satisfy these conditions. In addition, conditional graphical model was also studied under the same framework. The technical tools developed in this paper are of general interest to high dimensional principal component analysis. Thorough numerical results were also provided to back up the developed theory.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Estimation of functionals of sparse covariance matrices,2014,"  High-dimensional statistical tests often ignore correlations to gain simplicity and stability leading to null distributions that depend on functionals of correlation matrices such as their Frobenius norm and other $\ell_r$ norms. Motivated by the computation of critical values of such tests, we investigate the difficulty of estimation the functionals of sparse correlation matrices. Specifically, we show that simple plug-in procedures based on thresholded estimators of correlation matrices are sparsity-adaptive and minimax optimal over a large class of correlation matrices. Akin to previous results on functional estimation, the minimax rates exhibit an elbow phenomenon. Our results are further illustrated in simulated data as well as an empirical study of data arising in financial econometrics. ",https://doi.org/10.1214/15-AOS1357,1408.5087v2,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Robust Covariance Estimation for Approximate Factor Models,2016,"  In this paper, we study robust covariance estimation under the approximate factor model with observed factors. We propose a novel framework to first estimate the initial joint covariance matrix of the observed data and the factors, and then use it to recover the covariance matrix of the observed data. We prove that once the initial matrix estimator is good enough to maintain the element-wise optimal rate, the whole procedure will generate an estimated covariance with desired properties. For data with only bounded fourth moments, we propose to use Huber loss minimization to give the initial joint covariance estimation. This approach is applicable to a much wider range of distributions, including sub-Gaussian and elliptical distributions. We also present an asymptotic result for Huber's M-estimator with a diverging parameter. The conclusions are demonstrated by extensive simulations and real data analysis.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,An $\ell_{\infty}$ Eigenvector Perturbation Bound and Its Application to   Robust Covariance Estimation,2016,"  In statistics and machine learning, people are often interested in the eigenvectors (or singular vectors) of certain matrices (e.g. covariance matrices, data matrices, etc). However, those matrices are usually perturbed by noises or statistical errors, either from random sampling or structural patterns. One usually employs Davis-Kahan $\sin \theta$ theorem to bound the difference between the eigenvectors of a matrix $A$ and those of a perturbed matrix $\widetilde{A} = A + E$, in terms of $\ell_2$ norm. In this paper, we prove that when $A$ is a low-rank and incoherent matrix, the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm perturbation bound of singular vectors (or eigenvectors in the symmetric case) is smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{d_1}$ or $\sqrt{d_2}$ for left and right vectors, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the matrix dimensions. The power of this new perturbation result is shown in robust covariance estimation, particularly when random variables have heavy tails. There, we propose new robust covariance estimators and establish their asymptotic properties using the newly developed perturbation bound. Our theoretical results are verified through extensive numerical experiments. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,1603.03516v2,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Projected principal component analysis in factor models,2014,"  This paper introduces a Projected Principal Component Analysis (Projected-PCA), which employs principal component analysis to the projected (smoothed) data matrix onto a given linear space spanned by covariates. When it applies to high-dimensional factor analysis, the projection removes noise components. We show that the unobserved latent factors can be more accurately estimated than the conventional PCA if the projection is genuine, or more precisely, when the factor loading matrices are related to the projected linear space. When the dimensionality is large, the factors can be estimated accurately even when the sample size is finite. We propose a flexible semiparametric factor model, which decomposes the factor loading matrix into the component that can be explained by subject-specific covariates and the orthogonal residual component. The covariates' effects on the factor loadings are further modeled by the additive model via sieve approximations. By using the newly proposed Projected-PCA, the rates of convergence of the smooth factor loading matrices are obtained, which are much faster than those of the conventional factor analysis. The convergence is achieved even when the sample size is finite and is particularly appealing in the high-dimension-low-sample-size situation. This leads us to developing nonparametric tests on whether observed covariates have explaining powers on the loadings and whether they fully explain the loadings. The proposed method is illustrated by both simulated data and the returns of the components of the S&P 500 index. ",https://doi.org/10.1214/15-AOS1364,1406.3836v3,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,A Shrinkage Principle for Heavy-Tailed Data: High-Dimensional Robust   Low-Rank Matrix Recovery,2016,"  This paper introduces a simple principle for robust high-dimensional statistical inference via an appropriate shrinkage on the data. This widens the scope of high-dimensional techniques, reducing the moment conditions from sub-exponential or sub-Gaussian distributions to merely bounded second or fourth moment. As an illustration of this principle, we focus on robust estimation of the low-rank matrix $\Theta^*$ from the trace regression model $Y=Tr (\Theta^{*T}X) +\epsilon$. It encompasses four popular problems: sparse linear models, compressed sensing, matrix completion and multi-task regression. We propose to apply penalized least-squares approach to appropriately truncated or shrunk data. Under only bounded $2+\delta$ moment condition on the response, the proposed robust methodology yields an estimator that possesses the same statistical error rates as previous literature with sub-Gaussian errors. For sparse linear models and multi-tasking regression, we further allow the design to have only bounded fourth moment and obtain the same statistical rates, again, by appropriate shrinkage of the design matrix. As a byproduct, we give a robust covariance matrix estimator and establish its concentration inequality in terms of the spectral norm when the random samples have only bounded fourth moment. Extensive simulations have been carried out to support our theories. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,1603.08315v2,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Volatility prediction comparison via robust volatility proxies: An   empirical deviation perspective,2021,"  Volatility forecasting is crucial to risk management and portfolio construction. One particular challenge of assessing volatility forecasts is how to construct a robust proxy for the unknown true volatility. In this work, we show that the empirical loss comparison between two volatility predictors hinges on the deviation of the volatility proxy from the true volatility. We then establish non-asymptotic deviation bounds for three robust volatility proxies, two of which are based on clipped data, and the third of which is based on exponentially weighted Huber loss minimization. In particular, in order for the Huber approach to adapt to non-stationary financial returns, we propose to solve a tuning-free weighted Huber loss minimization problem to jointly estimate the volatility and the optimal robustification parameter at each time point. We then inflate this robustification parameter and use it to update the volatility proxy to achieve optimal balance between the bias and variance of the global empirical loss. We also extend this Huber method to construct volatility predictors. Finally, we exploit the proposed robust volatility proxy to compare different volatility predictors on the Bitcoin market data. It turns out that when the sample size is limited, applying the robust volatility proxy gives more consistent and stable evaluation of volatility forecasts. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2110.01189v1,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,"The $\mathbf{uvu}$-avoiding $(a,b,c)$-Generalized Motzkin paths with   vertical steps: bijections and statistic enumerations",2022,"  A generalized Motzkin path, called G-Motzkin path for short, of length $n$ is a lattice path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, 0)$ in the first quadrant of the XOY-plane that consists of up steps $\mathbf{u}=(1, 1)$, down steps $\mathbf{d}=(1, -1)$, horizontal steps $\mathbf{h}=(1, 0)$ and vertical steps $\mathbf{v}=(0, -1)$. An $(a,b,c)$-G-Motzkin path is a weighted G-Motzkin path such that the $\mathbf{u}$-steps, $\mathbf{h}$-steps, $\mathbf{v}$-steps and $\mathbf{d}$-steps are weighted respectively by $1, a, b$ and $c$. In this paper, we first give bijections between the set of $\mathbf{uvu}$-avoiding $(a,b,b^2)$-G-Motzkin paths of length $n$ and the set of $(a,b)$-Schr\""{o}der paths as well as the set of $(a+b,b)$-Dyck paths of length $2n$, between the set of $\{\mathbf{uvu, uu}\}$-avoiding $(a,b,b^2)$-G-Motzkin paths of length $n$ and the set of $(a+b,ab)$-Motzkin paths of length $n$, between the set of $\{\mathbf{uvu,uu}\}$-avoiding $(a,b,b^2)$-G-Motzkin paths of length $n+1$ beginning with an $\mathbf{h}$-step weighted by $a$ and the set of $(a,b)$-Dyck paths of length $2n+2$. In the last section, we focus on the enumeration of statistics ""number of $\mathbf{z}$-steps"" for $\mathbf{z}\in \{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{d}\}$ and ""number of points"" at given level in $\mathbf{uvu}$-avoiding G-Motzkin paths.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Ranking Inferences Based on the Top Choice of Multiway Comparisons,2022,"  This paper considers ranking inference of $n$ items based on the observed data on the top choice among $M$ randomly selected items at each trial. This is a useful modification of the Plackett-Luce model for $M$-way ranking with only the top choice observed and is an extension of the celebrated Bradley-Terry-Luce model that corresponds to $M=2$. Under a uniform sampling scheme in which any $M$ distinguished items are selected for comparisons with probability $p$ and the selected $M$ items are compared $L$ times with multinomial outcomes, we establish the statistical rates of convergence for underlying $n$ preference scores using both $\ell_2$-norm and $\ell_\infty$-norm, with the minimum sampling complexity. In addition, we establish the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator that allows us to construct confidence intervals for the underlying scores. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference framework for ranking items through a sophisticated maximum pairwise difference statistic whose distribution is estimated via a valid Gaussian multiplier bootstrap. The estimated distribution is then used to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for the differences in the preference scores and the ranks of individual items. They also enable us to address various inference questions on the ranks of these items. Extensive simulation studies lend further support to our theoretical results. A real data application illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methods convincingly. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2211.11957v3,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Inference on Time Series Nonparametric Conditional Moment Restrictions   Using General Sieves,2022,"  General nonlinear sieve learnings are classes of nonlinear sieves that can approximate nonlinear functions of high dimensional variables much more flexibly than various linear sieves (or series). This paper considers general nonlinear sieve quasi-likelihood ratio (GN-QLR) based inference on expectation functionals of time series data, where the functionals of interest are based on some nonparametric function that satisfy conditional moment restrictions and are learned using multilayer neural networks. While the asymptotic normality of the estimated functionals depends on some unknown Riesz representer of the functional space, we show that the optimally weighted GN-QLR statistic is asymptotically Chi-square distributed, regardless whether the expectation functional is regular (root-$n$ estimable) or not. This holds when the data are weakly dependent beta-mixing condition. We apply our method to the off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, by formulating the Bellman equation into the conditional moment restriction framework, so that we can make inference about the state-specific value functional using the proposed GN-QLR method with time series data. In addition, estimating the averaged partial means and averaged partial derivatives of nonparametric instrumental variables and quantile IV models are also presented as leading examples. Finally, a Monte Carlo study shows the finite sample performance of the procedure ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2301.00092v2,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Spectral Ranking Inferences based on General Multiway Comparisons,2023,"  This paper studies the performance of the spectral method in the estimation and uncertainty quantification of the unobserved preference scores of compared entities in a general and more realistic setup. Specifically, the comparison graph consists of hyper-edges of possible heterogeneous sizes, and the number of comparisons can be as low as one for a given hyper-edge. Such a setting is pervasive in real applications, circumventing the need to specify the graph randomness and the restrictive homogeneous sampling assumption imposed in the commonly used Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) or Plackett-Luce (PL) models. Furthermore, in scenarios where the BTL or PL models are appropriate, we unravel the relationship between the spectral estimator and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We discover that a two-step spectral method, where we apply the optimal weighting estimated from the equal weighting vanilla spectral method, can achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as the MLE. Given the asymptotic distributions of the estimated preference scores, we also introduce a comprehensive framework to carry out both one-sample and two-sample ranking inferences, applicable to both fixed and random graph settings. It is noteworthy that this is the first time effective two-sample rank testing methods have been proposed. Finally, we substantiate our findings via comprehensive numerical simulations and subsequently apply our developed methodologies to perform statistical inferences for statistical journals and movie rankings.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Estimation of Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratio for High Dimensional Portfolio   Optimization,2024,"  Portfolio optimization aims at constructing a realistic portfolio with significant out-of-sample performance, which is typically measured by the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. However, due to in-sample optimism, it is inappropriate to use the in-sample estimated covariance to evaluate the out-of-sample Sharpe, especially in the high dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio using only in-sample data, based on random matrix theory. Furthermore, portfolio managers can use the estimated out-of-sample Sharpe as a criterion to decide the best tuning for constructing their portfolios. Specifically, we consider the classical framework of Markowits mean-variance portfolio optimization with known mean vector and the high dimensional regime of $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, where $p$ is the portfolio dimension and $n$ is the number of samples or time points. We propose to correct the sample covariance by a regularization matrix and provide a consistent estimator of its Sharpe ratio. The new estimator works well under either of three conditions: (1) bounded covariance spectrum, (2) arbitrary number of diverging spikes when $c < 1$, and (3) fixed number of diverging spikes when $c \ge 1$. We can also extend the results to construct global minimum variance portfolio and correct out-of-sample efficient frontier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive simulations and real data experiments. Our results highlight the potential of this methodology as a powerful tool for portfolio optimization in high dimensional settings. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2406.03954v1,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Linear-Quadratic Mean-Field   Control/Game in Continuous Time,2020,"  Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool to learn the optimal policy of possibly multiple agents by interacting with the environment. As the number of agents grow to be very large, the system can be approximated by a mean-field problem. Therefore, it has motivated new research directions for mean-field control (MFC) and mean-field game (MFG). In this paper, we study the policy gradient method for the linear-quadratic mean-field control and game, where we assume each agent has identical linear state transitions and quadratic cost functions. While most of the recent works on policy gradient for MFC and MFG are based on discrete-time models, we focus on the continuous-time models where some analyzing techniques can be interesting to the readers. For both MFC and MFG, we provide policy gradient update and show that it converges to the optimal solution at a linear rate, which is verified by a synthetic simulation. For MFG, we also provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2008.06845v1,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Heterogeneity Adjustment with Applications to Graphical Model Inference,2016,"  Heterogeneity is an unwanted variation when analyzing aggregated datasets from multiple sources. Though different methods have been proposed for heterogeneity adjustment, no systematic theory exists to justify these methods. In this work, we propose a generic framework named ALPHA (short for Adaptive Low-rank Principal Heterogeneity Adjustment) to model, estimate, and adjust heterogeneity from the original data. Once the heterogeneity is adjusted, we are able to remove the biases of batch effects and to enhance the inferential power by aggregating the homogeneous residuals from multiple sources. Under a pervasive assumption that the latent heterogeneity factors simultaneously affect a large fraction of observed variables, we provide a rigorous theory to justify the proposed framework. Our framework also allows the incorporation of informative covariates and appeals to the ""Bless of Dimensionality"". As an illustrative application of this generic framework, we consider a problem of estimating high-dimensional precision matrix for graphical model inference based on multiple datasets. We also provide thorough numerical studies on both synthetic datasets and a brain imaging dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed theory and methods.

In this paper, we consider a kind of generalized Motzkin paths, called {\it G-Motzkin paths} for short, that is lattice paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, 0)$ in the first quadrant of the $XOY$-plane that consist of up steps $\mathbf{u}=(1, 1)$, down steps $\mathbf{d}=(1, -1)$, horizontal steps $\mathbf{h}=(1, 0)$ and vertical steps $\mathbf{v}=(0, -1)$. We mainly count the number of G-Motzkin paths of length $n$ with given number of $\mathbf{z}$-steps for $\mathbf{z}\in \{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{d}\}$, and enumerate the statistics ""number of $\mathbf{z}$-steps"" at given level in G-Motzkin paths for $\mathbf{z}\in \{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{d}\}$, some explicit formulas and combinatorial identities are given by bijective and algebraic methods, some enumerative results are linked with Riordan arrays according to the structure decompositions of G-Motzkin paths.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Using Mobile Data and Deep Models to Assess Auditory Verbal   Hallucinations,2023,"  Hallucination is an apparent perception in the absence of real external sensory stimuli. An auditory hallucination is a perception of hearing sounds that are not real. A common form of auditory hallucination is hearing voices in the absence of any speakers which is known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH). AVH is fragments of the mind's creation that mostly occur in people diagnosed with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Assessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive voices are) can help measure the severity of a mental illness. We study N=435 individuals, who experience hearing voices, to assess auditory verbal hallucination. Participants report the valence of voices they hear four times a day for a month through ecological momentary assessments with questions that have four answering scales from ``not at all'' to ``extremely''. We collect these self-reports as the valence supervision of AVH events via a mobile application. Using the application, participants also record audio diaries to describe the content of hallucinated voices verbally. In addition, we passively collect mobile sensing data as contextual signals. We then experiment with how predictive these linguistic and contextual cues from the audio diary and mobile sensing data are of an auditory verbal hallucination event. Finally, using transfer learning and data fusion techniques, we train a neural net model that predicts the valance of AVH with a performance of 54\% top-1 and 72\% top-2 F1 score.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix,2024,"  Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Estimation of the Laser Frequency Nosie Spectrum by Continuous Dynamical   Decoupling,2020,"  Decoherence induced by the laser frequency noise is one of the most important obstacles in the quantum information processing. In order to suppress this decoherence, the noise power spectral density needs to be accurately characterized. In particular, the noise spectrum measurement based on the coherence characteristics of qubits would be a meaningful and still challenging method. Here, we theoretically analyze and experimentally obtain the spectrum of laser frequency noise based on the continuous dynamical decoupling technique. We first estimate the mixture-noise (including laser and magnetic noises) spectrum up to $(2\pi)$530 kHz by monitoring the transverse relaxation from an initial state $+X$, followed by a gradient descent data process protocol. Then the contribution from the laser noise is extracted by enconding the qubits on different Zeeman sublevels. We also investigate two sufficiently strong noise components by making an analogy between these noises and driving lasers whose linewidth assumed to be negligible. This method is verified experimentally and finally helps to characterize the noise. ",https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.15.014033,2005.03908v3,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Simulating a Chern Insulator with C = $\pm$2 on Synthetic Floquet   Lattice,2024,"  The synthetic Floquet lattice, generated by multiple strong drives with mutually incommensurate frequencies, provides a powerful platform for the quantum simulation of topological phenomena. In this study, we propose a 4-band tight-binding model of the Chern insulator with a Chern number C = $\pm$2 by coupling two layers of the half-BHZ lattice and subsequently mapping it onto the Floquet lattice to simulate its topological properties. To determine the Chern number of our Floquet-version model, we extend the energy pumping method proposed by Martin et al. [Phys. Rev. X 7, 041008 (2017)] and the topological oscillation method introduced by Boyers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 160505 (2020)], followed by numerical simulations for both methodologies. The simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of the Chern number using either of these methods, providing an excellent prediction of the phase diagram that closely aligns with the theoretical one derived from the original bilayer half-BHZ model. Finally, we briefly discuss a potential experimental implementation for our model. Our work demonstrates significant potential for simulating complex topological matter using quantum computing platforms, thereby paving the way for constructing a more universal simulator for non-interacting topological quantum states and advancing our understanding of these intriguing phenomena.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,SDSS-IV MaNGA: Stellar rotational support in disk galaxies vs. central   surface density and stellar population age,2024,"  We investigate how the stellar rotational support changes as a function of spatially resolved stellar population age ($\rm D_n4000$) and relative central stellar surface density ($\Delta \Sigma_1$) for MaNGA isolated/central disk galaxies. We find that the galaxy rotational support $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ varies smoothly as a function of $\Delta \Sigma_1$ and $\rm D_n4000$. $\rm D_n4000$ vs. $\Delta \Sigma_1$ follows a ""J-shape"", with $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ contributing to the scatters. In this ""J-shaped"" pattern rotational support increases with central $\rm D_n4000$ when $\Delta \Sigma_1$ is low but decreases with $\Delta \Sigma_1$ when $\Delta \Sigma_1$ is high. Restricting attention to low-$\Delta \Sigma_1$ (i.e, large-radius) galaxies, we suggest that the trend of increasing rotational support with $\rm D_n4000$ for these objects is produced by a mix of two different processes, a primary trend characterized by growth in $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ along with mass through gas accretion, on top of which disturbance episodes are overlaid, which reduce rotational support and trigger increased star formation. An additional finding is that star forming galaxies with low $\Delta \Sigma_1$ have relatively larger radii than galaxies with higher $\Delta \Sigma_1$ at fixed stellar mass. Assuming that these relative radii rankings are preserved while galaxies are star forming then implies clear evolutionary paths in central $\rm D_n4000$ vs. $\Delta \Sigma_1$. The paper closes with comments on the implications that these paths have for the evolution of pseudo-bulges vs. classical-bulges. The utility of using $\rm D_n4000$-$\Delta \Sigma_1$ to study $\lambda_{R_\mathrm{e}}$ reinforces the notion that galaxy kinematics correlate both with structure and with stellar-population state, and indicates the importance of a multi-dimensional description for understanding bulge and galaxy evolution.

If an oncoming relapse can be predicted on time, for example by detecting early behavioral changes in patients, then interventions could be provided to prevent the relapse. In this work, we investigated a machine learning based schizophrenia relapse prediction model using mobile sensing data to characterize behavioral features. A patient-independent model providing sequential predictions, closely representing the clinical deployment scenario for relapse prediction, was evaluated. The model uses the mobile sensing data from the recent four weeks to predict an oncoming relapse in the next week. We used the behavioral rhythm features extracted from daily templates of mobile sensing data, self-reported symptoms collected via EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment), and demographics to compare different classifiers for the relapse prediction. Naive Bayes based model gave the best results with an F2 score of 0.083 when evaluated in a dataset consisting of 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a year. The obtained F2 score, though low, is better than the baseline performance of random classification (F2 score of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.024). Thus, mobile sensing has predictive value for detecting an oncoming relapse and needs further investigation to improve the current performance. Towards that end, further feature engineering and model personalization based on the behavioral idiosyncrasies of a patient could be helpful. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2106.15353v1,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,MoodCapture: Depression Detection Using In-the-Wild Smartphone Images,2024,"  MoodCapture presents a novel approach that assesses depression based on images automatically captured from the front-facing camera of smartphones as people go about their daily lives. We collect over 125,000 photos in the wild from N=177 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder for 90 days. Images are captured naturalistically while participants respond to the PHQ-8 depression survey question: \textit{``I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless''}. Our analysis explores important image attributes, such as angle, dominant colors, location, objects, and lighting. We show that a random forest trained with face landmarks can classify samples as depressed or non-depressed and predict raw PHQ-8 scores effectively.

In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV-B color gradients in ~1400 large ($\rm r_e>0.18^{\prime\prime}$), nearly face-on (b/a>0.5) main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and 1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the origin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z~1 and discuss their link with the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally compact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more negative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally diffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on optical-SED fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ($M_{\ast} <10^{10}M_{\odot}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the high-mass ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative color gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar masses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Resolving the physics of Quasar Ly$α$ Nebulae (RePhyNe): I.   Constraining Quasar host halo masses through Circumgalactic Medium kinematics,2023,"  Ly$\alpha$ nebulae ubiquitously found around z>2 quasars can supply unique constraints on the properties of the Circumgalactic Medium, such as its density distribution, provided the quasar halo mass is known. We present a new method to constrain quasar halo masses based on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion maps of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. By using MUSE-like mock observations obtained from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations under the assumption of maximal quasar fluorescence, we show that the velocity dispersion radial profiles of Ly$\alpha$-emitting gas are strongly determined by gravity and that they are thus self-similar with respect to halo mass when rescaled by the virial radius. Through simple analytical arguments and by exploiting the kinematics of HeII1640\.A emission for a set of observed nebulae, we show that Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects plausibly do not change the shape of the velocity dispersion profiles but only their normalisation without breaking their self-similarity. Taking advantage of these results, we define the variable $\eta^{140-200}_{40-100}$ as the ratio of the median velocity dispersion in two specifically selected annuli and derive an analytical relation between $\eta^{140-200}_{40-100}$ and the halo mass which can be directly applied to observations. We apply our method to 37 observed quasar Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at 3<z<4.7 and find that their associated quasars are typically hosted by ~$10^{12.16 \pm 0.14}$ M$_{\odot}$ haloes independent of redshift within the explored range. This measurement, which is completely independent of clustering methods, is consistent with the lowest mass estimates based on quasar auto-correlation clustering at z~3 and with quasar-galaxies cross-correlation results.

However, it is not well known where inside galaxies these winds are launched from. We study the cool winds ($\sim 10^4$\,K) in two spatial regions of a massive galaxy at $z=1.3$, which we nickname the ""Baltimore Oriole's Nest."" The galaxy has a stellar mass of $10^{10.3\pm 0.3} M_\odot$, is located on the star-forming main sequence, and has a morphology indicative of a recent merger. Gas kinematics indicate a dynamically complex system with velocity gradients ranging from 0 to 60 $\mathrm{km}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The two regions studied are: a dust-reddened center (Central region), and a blue arc at 7 kpc from the center (Arc region). We measure the \ion{Fe}{2} and \ion{Mg}{2} absorption line profiles from deep Keck/DEIMOS spectra. Blueshifted wings up to 450 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ are found for both regions. The \ion{Fe}{2} column densities of winds are $10^{14.7\pm 0.2}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and $10^{14.6\pm 0.2}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ toward the Central and Arc regions, respectively. Our measurements suggest that the winds are most likely launched from both regions. The winds may be driven by the spatially extended star formation, the surface density of which is around 0.2 $M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\cdot \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ in both regions. The mass outflow rates are estimated to be $4\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $3\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for the Central and Arc regions, with uncertainties of one order-of-magnitude or more. Findings of this work and a few previous studies suggest that the cool galactic winds at $z\gtrsim 1$ might be commonly launched from the entire spatial extents of their host galaxies due to extended galaxy star formation.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Galaxy inclination and the IRX-beta relation: Effects on UV   star-formation rate measurements at intermediate to high redshifts,2018,"  At intermediate and high redshifts, measurements of galaxy star-formation rates are usually based on rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) data. A correction for dust attenuation, A_UV, is needed for these measurements. This correction is typically inferred from UV spectral slopes (beta) using an equation known as ""Meurer's Relation."" In this paper, we study this relation at a redshift of 1.5 using images and photometric measurements in the rest-frame UV (HST) through mid-infrared (Spitzer). It is shown that massive star-forming galaxies (above 10^10 Msun) have dust corrections that are dependent on their inclination to the line-of-sight. Edge-on galaxies have higher A_UV and infrared excess (IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)) than face-on galaxies at a given beta. Interestingly, dust corrections for low-mass star-forming galaxies do not depend on inclination. This is likely because more massive galaxies have more disk-like shapes/kinematics, while low-mass galaxies are more prolate and have more disturbed kinematics. To account for an inclination-dependent dust correction, a modified Meurer's Relation is derived: A_UV=4.43+1.99 beta - 1.73 (b/a-0.67), where b/a is the galaxy axis ratio. This inclination-dependence of A_UV can be explained by a two-component model of the dust distribution inside galaxies. In such a model, the dust attenuation of edge-on galaxies has a higher contribution from a ""mixture"" component (dust uniformly mixed with stars in the diffuse interstellar medium), and a lower contribution from a ""birth cloud"" component (near-spherical dust shells surrounding young stars in H II regions) than that of face-on galaxies. The difference is caused by the larger path-lengths through disks at higher inclinations. ",https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaef79,1811.03671v1,No,

In this Letter, we extend our previous work on the origins of $NUV-B$ color gradients in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z\sim1$ to those at $z\sim2$. We use a sample of 1335 large (semi-major axis radius $R_{\rm SMA}>0.''18$) SFGs with extended UV emission out to $2R_{\rm SMA}$ in the mass range $M_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{11}M_{\odot}$ at $1.5<z<2.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. We show that these SFGs generally have negative $NUV-B$ color gradients (redder centres), and their color gradients strongly increase with galaxy mass. We also show that the global rest-frame $FUV-NUV$ color is approximately linear with $A_{\rm V}$, which is derived by modeling the observed integrated FUV to NIR spectral energy distributions of the galaxies. Applying this integrated calibration to our spatially-resolved data, we find a negative dust gradient (more dust extinguished in the centers), which steadily becomes steeper with galaxy mass. We further find that the $NUV-B$ color gradients become nearly zero after correcting for dust gradients regardless of galaxy mass. This indicates that the sSFR gradients are negligible and dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative UV-optical color gradients in these SFGs. Our findings support that the buildup of the stellar mass in SFGs at the Cosmic Noon is self-similar inside $2R_{\rm SMA}$. ",https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aa7cf5,1707.00226v1,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Distinguishing Mergers and Disks in High Redshift Observations of Galaxy   Kinematics,2019,"  The majority of massive star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ have velocity gradients suggestive of rotation, in addition to large amounts of disordered motions. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is challenging to distinguish the regular rotation of a disk galaxy from the orbital motions of merging galaxies with seeing-limited data. However, the merger fractions at $z\sim2$ are likely too low for this to have a large effect on measurements of disk fractions. To determine how often mergers pass for disks, we look to galaxy formation simulations. We analyze $\sim$24000 synthetic images and kinematic maps of 31 high-resolution simulations of isolated galaxies and mergers at $z\sim2$. We determine if the synthetic observations pass criteria commonly used to identify disk galaxies, and whether the results are consistent with their intrinsic dynamical states. Galaxies that are intrinsically mergers pass the disk criteria for anywhere from 0 to 100$\%$ of sightlines. The exact percentage depends strongly on the specific disk criteria adopted, and weakly on the separation of the merging galaxies. Therefore, one cannot tell with certainty whether observations of an individual galaxy indicate a merger or a disk. To estimate the fraction of mergers passing as disks in current kinematics samples, we combine the probability that a merger will pass as a disk with theoretical merger fractions from a cosmological simulation. Taking the latter at face-value, the observed disk fractions are overestimated by small amounts: at most by $5\%$ at high stellar mass ($10^{10-11}$ M$_{\odot}$) and $15\%$ at low stellar mass ($10^{9-10}$ M$_{\odot}$).

Based on the average size versus stellar-mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies into Small SFGs (SSFGs), i.e., smaller than average for its mass, and Large SFGs (LSFGs), i.e., larger than average. We find that, at low masses ($M_{\ast} < 10^{10}M_{\odot}$), the SSFGs generally have nearly flat $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ profiles for both edge-on and face-on views, especially at redshifts $z>1$. Moreover, the median A$_4$ values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast, the highly-inclined, low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically increasing $\varepsilon$ with radius and are dominated by disky values at intermediate radii. These findings at intermediate redshifts imply that low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, while low-mass LSFGs appear to harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotation. At high masses ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$), highly-inclined SSFGs and LSFGs both exhibit a general, distinct trend for both $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ profiles: increasing values with radius at lower radii, reaching maxima at intermediate radii, and then decreasing values at larger radii. Such a trend is more prevalent for more massive ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$) galaxies or those at lower redshifts ($z<1.4$). The distinct trend in $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ can be simply explained if galaxies possess all three components: central bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like stellar components in the outskirts.

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,On the Transition of the Galaxy Quenching Mode at 0.5<z<1 in CANDELS,2018,"  We investigate the galaxy quenching process at intermediate redshift using a sample of $\sim4400$ galaxies with $M_{\ast} > 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. We divide this sample, using the integrated specific star formation rate (sSFR), into four sub-groups: star-forming galaxies (SFGs) above and below the ridge of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS), transition galaxies and quiescent galaxies. We study their $UVI$ ($U-V$ versus $V-I$) color gradients to infer their sSFR gradients out to twice effective radii. We show that on average both star-forming and transition galaxies at all masses are not fully quenched at any radii, whereas quiescent galaxies are fully quenched at all radii. We find that at low masses ($M_{\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{10}M_{\odot}$) SFGs both above and below the SFMS ridge generally have flat sSFR profiles, whereas the transition galaxies at the same masses generally have sSFRs that are more suppressed in their outskirts. In contrast, at high masses ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$), SFGs above and below the SFMS ridge and transition galaxies generally have varying degrees of more centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts. These findings indicate that at $z\sim~0.5-1.0$ the main galaxy quenching mode depends on its already formed stellar mass, exhibiting a transition from ""the outside-in"" at $M_{\ast} \leq 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ to ""the inside-out"" at $M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$. In other words, our findings support that internal processes dominate the quenching of massive galaxies, whereas external processes dominate the quenching of low-mass galaxies.

The majority ($\sim$65\%) of the galaxies come from the HALO7D survey, with the remainder from the DEEPwinds program. This catalog includes redshifts for 646 dwarf galaxies with $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.5$. 810 catalog galaxies did not have previously published spectroscopic redshifts, including 454 dwarf galaxies. HALO7D used the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II telescope to take very deep (up to 32 hours exposure, with a median of $\sim$7 hours) optical spectroscopy in the COSMOS, EGS, GOODS-North, and GOODS-South CANDELS fields, and in some areas outside CANDELS. We compare our redshift results to existing spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in these fields, finding only a 1\% rate of discrepancy with other spectroscopic redshifts. We measure a small increase in median photometric redshift error (from 1.0\% to 1.3\%) and catastrophic outlier rate (from 3.5\% to 8\%) with decreasing stellar mass. We obtained successful redshift fits for 75\% of massive galaxies, and demonstrate a similar 70-75\% successful redshift measurement rate in $8.5 < \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.5$ galaxies, suggesting similar survey sensitivity in this low-mass range. We describe the redshift, mass, and color-magnitude distributions of the catalog galaxies, finding HALO7D galaxies representative of CANDELS galaxies up to \textit{i}-band magnitudes of 25.

Diverse Populations of Circumgalactic Ly$α$   Nebulae at Cosmic Noon,2024,"  Circumgalactic Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) nebulae are gaseous halos around galaxies exhibiting luminous extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This work investigates Ly$\alpha$ nebulae from deep imaging of $\sim12~\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky, targeted by the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey. Utilizing the wide-field capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), we present one of the largest blind Ly$\alpha$ nebula selections, including QSO nebulae, Ly$\alpha$ blobs, and radio galaxy nebulae down to typical $2\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness of $(5-10)\times10^{-18}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. The sample contains 117 nebulae with Ly$\alpha$ sizes of 40 - 400 kpc, and the most gigantic one spans about 365 kpc, referred to as the Ivory Nebula. Combining with multiwavelength data, we investigate diverse nebula populations and associated galaxies. We find a small fraction of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae have QSOs ($\sim7\%$), luminous infrared galaxies ($\sim1\%$), and radio galaxies ($\sim 2\%$). Remarkably, among the 28 enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe) exceeding 100 kpc, about $80\%$ are associated with UV-faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{UV} > -22$), categorized as Type II ELANe. We underscore that Type II ELANe constitute the majority but remain largely hidden in current galaxy and QSO surveys. Dusty starburst and obscured AGN activity are proposed to explain the nature of Type II ELANe. The SED of stacking all Ly$\alpha$ nebulae also reveals signs of massive dusty star-forming galaxies with obscured AGNs. We propose a model to explain the dusty nature where the diverse populations of Ly$\alpha$ nebula capture massive galaxies at different evolutionary stages undergoing violent assembling. Ly$\alpha$ nebulae provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of today's massive cluster galaxies at cosmic noon. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2405.13113v1,No,

We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (i.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS, UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2--2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global $A_V$. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting $A_V$ profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for $M_*>10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$, where central declines of 20--25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) $A_V$ measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar-mass surface densities there.

We present the spatial distributions of galaxies and quasars and an HI absorption map of the intergalactic medium (IGM). On the map of 465 galaxies selected from the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey, we find two galaxy density peaks that do not fall on the quasar overdensity but instead exist at the northwest and southeast sides, approximately 25 $h^{-1}$ comoving-Mpc apart from the quasar overdensity. With a spatial resolution of 15 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc in projection, we produce a three-dimensional HI tomography map by the IGM Ly$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of 23 SDSS/eBOSS quasars behind the quasar overdensity. Surprisingly, the quasar overdensity coincides with neither an absorption peak nor a transmission peak of IGM HI but lies near the border separating opaque and transparent volumes, with the more luminous quasars located in an environment with lesser IGM HI. Hence remarkably, the overdensity region traced by the 11 quasars, albeit all in coherently active states, has no clear coincidence with peaks of galaxies or HI absorption densities. Current physical scenarios with mixtures of HI overdensities and quasar photoionization cannot fully interpret the emergence of Cosmic Himalayas, suggesting this peculiar structure is an excellent laboratory to unveil the interplay between galaxies, quasars, and the IGM.

Physical Properties of UV-bright Clumps   at $0.5\leq z<3$,2017,"  Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed ""clumps"" in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed ""clumps"" in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at $0.5 \leq z < 3.0$. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties, e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (M*), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction, are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U-V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semi-major axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and M* of the host galaxies: at a fixed M*, the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with M*. Based on our SED-fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B-V) gradient, and a positive specific star formation rate gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. [Abridged] ",https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaa018,1712.01858v1,No,

We leverage the power of {\it{JWST}} CEERS NIRCam images to present the first quantitative identification and characterization of stellar bars at $z>1$ based on rest-frame NIR F444W images of high resolution (~1.3 kpc at z ~ 1-3). We identify stellar bars in these images using quantitative criteria based on ellipse fits. For this pilot study, we present six examples of robustly identified bars at $z>1$ with spectroscopic redshifts, including the two highest redshift bars at ~2.136 and 2.312 quantitatively identified and characterized to date. The stellar bars at $z$ ~ 1.1-2.3 presented in our study have projected semi-major axes of ~2.9-4.3 kpc and projected ellipticities of ~0.41-0.53 in the rest-frame NIR. The barred host galaxies have stellar masses ~ $ 1 \times 10^{10}$ to $2 \times 10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, star formation rates of ~ 21-295 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and several have potential nearby companions. Our finding of bars at $z$ ~1.1-2.3 demonstrates the early onset of such instabilities and supports simulations where bars form early in massive dynamically cold disks. It also suggests that if these bars at lookback times of 8-10 Gyr survive out to present epochs, bar-driven secular processes may operate over a long time and have a significant impact on some galaxies by z ~ 0.

To do this, we rely on spectral energy distribution (SED) models which allow us to infer physical parameters from spectrophotometric data. In recent years, thanks to the wide and deep multi-waveband galaxy surveys, the volume of high quality data have significantly increased. Alongside the increased data, algorithms performing SED fitting have improved, including better modeling prescriptions, newer templates, and more extensive sampling in wavelength space. We present a comprehensive analysis of different SED fitting codes including their methods and output with the aim of measuring the uncertainties caused by the modeling assumptions. We apply fourteen of the most commonly used SED fitting codes on samples from the CANDELS photometric catalogs at z~1 and z~3. We find agreement on the stellar mass, while we observe some discrepancies in the star formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation results. To explore the differences and biases among the codes, we explore the impact of the various modeling assumptions as they are set in the codes (e.g., star formation histories, nebular, dust, and AGN models) on the derived stellar masses, SFRs, and A_V values. We then assess the difference among the codes on the SFR-stellar mass relation and we measure the contribution to the uncertainties by the modeling choices (i.e., the modeling uncertainties) in stellar mass (~0.1dex), SFR (~0.3dex), and dust attenuation (~0.3mag).

The nature of these sources is threefold: (1) 71% are dusty star-forming galaxies at 2<z<6 with masses 9<log M/M_sun<11 and a variety of specific SFRs (<1 to >100 Gyr^-1); (2) 18% are quiescent/dormant (i.e., subject to reignition and rejuvenation) galaxies at 3<z<5, masses log M/M_sun~10 and post-starburst stellar mass-weighted ages (0.5-1 Gyr); and (3) 11% are strong young starbursts with indications of high-EW emission lines (typically, [OIII]+Hbeta) at 6<z<7 and log M/M_sun~9.5. The sample is dominated by disk-like galaxies with a remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4 kpc). Large attenuations in SFGs, 2<A(V)<5 mag, are found within 1.5 times the effective radius, approximately 2 kpc, while QGs present A(V)~0.2 mag. Our SED-fitting technique reproduces the expected dust emission luminosities of IR-bright and sub-millimeter galaxies. This study implies high levels of star formation activity between z~20 and z~10, where virtually 100% of our galaxies had already formed 10^8 M_sun of their stellar content, 60% of them had assembled 10^9 M_sun, and 10% up to 10^10 M_sun (in situ or ex situ).

0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,"A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away: A Candidate z ~ 12 Galaxy in   Early JWST CEERS Imaging",2022,"  We report the discovery of a candidate galaxy with a photo-z of z~12 in the first epoch of the JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. Following conservative selection criteria we identify a source with a robust z_phot = 11.8^+0.3_-0.2 (1-sigma uncertainty) with m_F200W=27.3, and >7-sigma detections in five filters. The source is not detected at lambda < 1.4um in deep imaging from both HST and JWST, and has faint ~3-sigma detections in JWST F150W and HST F160W, which signal a Ly-alpha break near the red edge of both filters, implying z~12. This object (Maisie's Galaxy) exhibits F115W-F200W > 1.9 mag (2-sigma lower limit) with a blue continuum slope, resulting in 99.6% of the photo-z PDF favoring z > 11. All data quality images show no artifacts at the candidate's position, and independent analyses consistently find a strong preference for z > 11. Its colors are inconsistent with Galactic stars, and it is resolved (r_h = 340 +/- 14 pc). Maisie's Galaxy has log M*/Msol ~ 8.5 and is highly star-forming (log sSFR ~ -8.2 yr^-1), with a blue rest-UV color (beta ~ -2.5) indicating little dust though not extremely low metallicity. While the presence of this source is in tension with most predictions, it agrees with empirical extrapolations assuming UV luminosity functions which smoothly decline with increasing redshift. Should followup spectroscopy validate this redshift, our Universe was already aglow with galaxies less than 400 Myr after the Big Bang. ",https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac966e,2207.12474v2,No,
0000-0002-2869-226X,Weichen Wang,CAU,Dusty Starbursts Masquerading as Ultra-high Redshift Galaxies in JWST   CEERS Observations,2022,"  Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates at z>10 are rapidly being identified in JWST/NIRCam observations. Due to the (redshifted) break produced by neutral hydrogen absorption of rest-frame UV photons, these sources are expected to drop out in the bluer filters while being well detected in redder filters. However, here we show that dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts (z<7) may also mimic the near-infrared (near-IR) colors of z>10 LBGs, representing potential contaminants in LBG candidate samples. First, we analyze CEERS-DSFG-1, a NIRCam dropout undetected in the F115W and F150W filters but detected at longer wavelengths. Combining the JWST data with (sub)millimeter constraints, including deep NOEMA interferometric observations, we show that this source is a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at z~5.1. We also present a tentative 2.6sigma SCUBA-2 detection at 850um around a recently identified z~16 LBG candidate in the same field and show that, if the emission is real and associated with this candidate, the available photometry is consistent with a z~5 dusty galaxy with strong nebular emission lines despite its blue near-IR colors. Further observations on this candidate are imperative to mitigate the low confidence of this tentative submillimeter emission and its positional uncertainty. Our analysis shows that robust (sub)millimeter detections of NIRCam dropout galaxies likely imply z=4-6 redshift solutions, where the observed near-IR break would be the result of a strong rest-frame optical Balmer break combined with high dust attenuation and strong nebular line emission, rather than the rest-frame UV Lyman break. This provides evidence that DSFGs may contaminate searches for ultra high-redshift LBG candidates from JWST observations. ",https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/acacfe,2208.01816v3,Yes,potent(1)

0000-0002-5984-9872,Carsten Schultz,Christian Albrechts Universität,"Graph colourings, spaces of edges and spaces of circuits",2006,"  By Lovasz' proof of the Kneser conjecture, the chromatic number of a graph G is bounded from below by the index of the Z_2-space Hom(K_2,G) plus two. We show that the cohomological index of Hom(K_2,G) is also greater than the cohomological index of the Z_2-space Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) for r>0. This gives a new and simple proof of the strong form of the graph colouring theorem by Babson and Kozlov, which had been conjectured by Lovasz, and at the same time shows that it never gives a stronger bound than can be obtained by Hom(K_2, G). The proof extends ideas introduced by Zivaljevic in a previous elegant proof of a special case. We then generalise the arguments and obtain conditions under which corresponding results hold for other graphs in place of C_{2r+1}. This enables us to find an infinite family of test graphs of chromatic number 4 among the Kneser graphs.   Our main new result is a description of the Z_2-homotopy type of the direct limit of the system of all the spaces Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) in terms of the Z_2-homotopy type of Hom(K_2, G). A corollary is that the coindex of Hom(K_2, G) does not exceed the coindex of Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) by more then one if r is chosen sufficiently large. Thus the graph colouring bound in the theorem by Babson & Kozlov is also never weaker than that from Lovasz' proof of the Kneser conjecture. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,math/0606763v1,No,
0000-0002-5984-9872,Carsten Schultz,Christian Albrechts Universität,Topology of Hom complexes and test graphs for bounding chromatic number,2009,"  We introduce new methods for understanding the topology of $\Hom$ complexes (spaces of homomorphisms between two graphs), mostly in the context of group actions on graphs and posets. We view $\Hom(T,-)$ and $\Hom(-,G)$ as functors from graphs to posets, and introduce a functor $(-)^1$ from posets to graphs obtained by taking atoms as vertices. Our main structural results establish useful interpretations of the equivariant homotopy type of $\Hom$ complexes in terms of spaces of equivariant poset maps and $\Gamma$-twisted products of spaces. When $P = F(X)$ is the face poset of a simplicial complex $X$, this provides a useful way to control the topology of $\Hom$ complexes.   Our foremost application of these results is the construction of new families of `test graphs' with arbitrarily large chromatic number - graphs $T$ with the property that the connectivity of $\Hom(T,G)$ provides the best possible lower bound on the chromatic number of $G$. In particular we focus on two infinite families, which we view as higher dimensional analogues of odd cycles. The family of `spherical graphs' have connections to the notion of homomorphism duality, whereas the family of `twisted toroidal graphs' lead us to establish a weakened version of a conjecture (due to Lov\'{a}sz) relating topological lower bounds on chromatic number to maximum degree. Other structural results allow us to show that any finite simplicial complex $X$ with a free action by the symmetric group $S_n$ can be approximated up to $S_n$-homotopy equivalence as $\Hom(K_n,G)$ for some graph $G$; this is a generalization of a result of Csorba.

We then demonstrate how such a chain map induces a ""Z_k-combinatorial Stokes theorem"", which in turn implies ""Dold's theorem"" that there is no equivariant map from an n-connected to an n-dimensional free Z_k-complex.   Thus we build a combinatorial access road to problems in combinatorics and discrete geometry that have previously been treated with methods from equivariant topology.

In addition, our simulations reveal a discontinuous transition between these two limits. It is found that already a moderate ion drift velocity (M\approx0.1) destabilizes the highly ordered Yukawa balls and initiates an abrupt melting transition. The critical value of M is found to be independent of the cluster size. ",https://doi.org/10.1088/0741-3335/54/4/045011,1201.1711v1,No,

Increasing the magnetization of the ions, we find that the shape of the potential crucially depends on the Mach number $M$.

Knowing the effective dust-dust interaction, the multiscale problem can be effectively reduced to a one-component plasma model of the dust subsystem. The goal of the present publication is a systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential distribution around a dust grain in the presence of a streaming plasma environment by means of two complementary approaches: (i) a high precision computation of the dynamically screened Coulomb potential from the dynamic dielectric function, and (ii) full 3D particle-in-cell simulations, which self-consistently include dynamical grain charging and non-linear effects.

0000-0002-2921-7575,Patrick Ludwig,Christian Albrechts Universität,The ion potential in warm dense matter: wake effects due to streaming   degenerate electrons,2014,"  The effective dynamically screened potential of a classical ion in a stationary flowing quantum plasma at finite temperature is investigated. This is a key quantity for thermodynamics and transport of dense plasmas in the warm dense matter regime. This potential has been studied before within hydrodynamic approaches or based on the zero temperature Lindhard dielectric function. Here we extend the kinetic analysis by including the effects of finite temperature and of collisions based on the Mermin dielectric function. The resulting ion potential exhibits an oscillatory structure with attractive minima (wakes) and, thus, strongly deviates from the static Yukawa potential of equilibrium plasmas. This potential is analyzed in detail for high-density plasmas with values of the Brueckner parameter in the range $0.1 \le r_s \le 1$, for a broad range of plasma temperature and electron streaming velocity. It is shown that wake effects become weaker with increasing temperature of the electrons. Finally, we obtain the minimal electron streaming velocity for which attraction between ions occurs. This velocity turns out to be less than the electron Fermi velocity. Our results allow, for the first time, for reliable predictions of the strength of wake effects in nonequilibrium quantum plasmas with fast streaming electrons showing that these effects are crucial for transport under warm dense matter conditions, in particular for laser-matter interaction, electron-ion temperature equilibration and for stopping power.

The wake features formed for non-Maxwellian ions exhibit significant deviations from those observed within the model of a shifted Maxwellian distribution. The dependence of the peak amplitude and position of the wake potential upon the degree of collisionality is analyzed for a wide range of streaming velocities (Mach numbers). In contrast to a shifted Maxwellian distribution of ions, the drift-driven non-Maxwellian distribution exhibits an increase of the wake amplitude of the first attractive peak with increase in collisionality for high streaming velocities. At very low Mach numbers, collision-induced amplification is observed for Maxwellian as well as non-Maxwellian distributions. ",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5008898,1702.07152v1,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-2921-7575,Patrick Ludwig,Christian Albrechts Universität,Controlling strongly correlated dust clusters with lasers,2014,"  The most attractive feature of dusty plasmas is the possibility to create strong correlations at room temperatures. At the same time, these plasmas allow for a precise diagnostics with single-particle resolution. From such measurements, the structural properties of finite two-dimensional (2D) clusters and three-dimensional (3D) spherical crystals in nearly harmonic traps-Yukawa balls-have been explored in great detail. Their structural properties-the shell compositions and the order within the shells-have been investigated and good agreement to theoretical predictions was found. Open questions on the agenda are the excitation behavior, the structural changes, and phase transitions that occur at elevated temperature.   In order to increase the dust temperature in the experiment various techniques have been used. Among them, laser heating appears to have unique capabilities because it affects only the dust particles, leaving the lighter plasma components unchanged. Here we report on recent experimental results where laser heating methods were further improved and applied to finite 2D and 3D clusters. Comparing to simulations, we demonstrate that this indeed allows to increase the temperature in a controlled manner. For the analysis of thermodynamics and phase transitions in these finite systems, we present theoretical and experimental results on the basis of the instantaneous normal modes, pair distribution function and the recently introduced center-two-particle distribution function.

Bringing processes in the industry to a certain level of autonomy using data-driven models is particularly challenging as the first user of those models, is the expert in the process with often decades of experience. It is necessary to expose to the process engineer, not solely the model predictions, but also their interpretability. To that end, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method has gained a lot of interest from the research community recently. The principle of this method is to train a linear model that is locally approximating the black-box model, by generating randomly artificial data points locally. Model-agnostic local interpretability solutions based on LIME have recently emerged to improve the original method. We present in this paper a novel approach, VAE-LIME, for local interpretability of data-driven models forecasting the temperature of the hot metal produced by a blast furnace. Such ironmaking process data is characterized by multivariate time series with high inter-correlation representing the underlying process in a blast furnace. Our contribution is to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn the complex blast furnace process characteristics from the data. The VAE is aiming at generating optimal artificial samples to train a local interpretable model better representing the black-box model in the neighborhood of the input sample processed by the black-box model to make a prediction. In comparison with LIME, VAE-LIME is showing a significantly improved local fidelity of the local interpretable linear model with the black-box model resulting in robust model interpretability.

However, tactile sensors on multi-fingered hands have a variety of sizes and shapes. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be useful for processing tactile information, but the information from multi-fingered hands needs an arbitrary pre-processing, as CNNs require a rectangularly shaped input, which may lead to unstable results. Therefore, how to process such complex shaped tactile information and utilize it for achieving manipulation skills is still an open issue. This paper presents a control method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) which extracts geodesical features from the tactile data with complicated sensor alignments. Moreover, object property labels are provided to the GCN to adjust in-hand manipulation motions. Distributed tri-axial tactile sensors are mounted on the fingertips, finger phalanges and palm of an Allegro hand, resulting in 1152 tactile measurements. Training data is collected with a data-glove to transfer human dexterous manipulation directly to the robot hand. The GCN achieved high success rates for in-hand manipulation. We also confirmed that fragile objects were deformed less when correct object labels were provided to the GCN. When visualizing the activation of the GCN with a PCA, we verified that the network acquired geodesical features.

Presently, many researchers focus on capturing only position or joint angle data from humans to teach the robots. Even though this approach has yielded impressive results for grasping applications, reconstructing motion for object handling or fine manipulation from a human hand to a robot hand has been sparsely explored. Humans use tactile feedback to adjust their motion to various objects, but capturing and reproducing the applied forces is an open research question. In this paper we introduce a wearable fingertip tactile sensor, which captures the distributed 3-axis force vectors on the fingertip. The fingertip tactile sensor is interchangeable between the human hand and the robot hand, meaning that it can also be assembled to fit on a robot hand such as the Allegro hand. This paper presents the structural aspects of the sensor as well as the methodology and approach used to design, manufacture, and calibrate the sensor. The sensor is able to measure forces accurately with a mean absolute error of 0.21, 0.16, and 0.44 Newtons in X, Y, and Z directions, respectively. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2310.09201v1,No,

Morphological and immunohistochemical features of malignant cells and their distribution differ from other cancer types. Based on systematic tissue image analysis, computer-aided exploration can provide new insights into Hodgkin lymphoma pathology. In this paper, we report results from an image analysis of CD30 immunostained Hodgkin lymphoma tissue section images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic application of image analysis to a set of tissue sections of Hodgkin lymphoma. We have implemented an automatic procedure to handle and explore image data in Aperio's SVS format. We use pre-processing approaches on a down-scaled image to separate the image objects from the background. Then, we apply a supervised classification method to assign pixels to predefined classes. Our pre-processing method is able to separate the tissue content of images from the image background. We analyzed three immunohistologically defined groups, non-lymphoma and the two most common forms of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity type. We found that nodular sclerosis and non-lymphoma images exhibit different amounts of CD30 stain, whereas mixed cellularity type exhibits a large variance and overlaps with the other groups.

The polarization pattern is uniform for both bands and parallel to the filament structure. The polarization degree decreases toward regions with high intensity for both bands, revealing a so called ""polarization hole."" We identified an optical depth effect in which polarized emission and extinction act as counteracting mechanisms as a potential contributor to this phenomenon. Assuming that the detected polarization is caused by the emission of magnetically aligned non-spherical dust grains, the inferred magnetic field is uniform and oriented perpendicular to the filament. The magnetic field strength derived from the polarization patterns at 154$\,\mu$m and 214$\,\mu$m amounts to 202$\,\mu$G and 261$\,\mu$G, respectively. The derived magnetic field direction is consistent with that derived from previous polarimetric observations in the far infrared and submillimeter (submm) wavelength range. Investigating the far-infrared polarization spectrum derived from the SOFIA/HAWC+ observations, we do not find a clear correlation between the polarization spectrum and cloud properties, namely, the column density, $N(H_2$), and temperature, $T$.

0000-0002-3542-2583,Niko Zielinski,Kiel University,Constraining the magnetic field properties of Bok globule B335 using   SOFIA/HAWC+,2020,"  Thanks to their well-defined shape and mostly isolated locations, Bok globules are suitable objects for studying the physics of low-mass star formation. To study the magnetic field of the prototypical Bok globule B335, we obtained a spatially resolved polarization map with SOFIA/HAWC+ at a wavelength of 214$\,\mu$m. For the first time, these observations reveal that polarization holes in Bok globules, that is, the decrease in polarization degree towards their dense centers, also occur in the far-infrared wavelength regime. The observed polarization pattern is uniform with a mean polarization angle of 48$^\circ\pm $26$^\circ$ and a magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 142$\,\mu$G. Moreover, we use complementary polarimetic data for B335 obtained at near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths to analyze and constrain the magnetic field across different scales. By applying the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016), we developed a model for the density and magnetic field structure as well as for the dust properties of this globule. We conclude that the column density towards the center of B335 is too low to cause the observed polarization hole in B335 via dichroic absorption (Brauer et al. 2016). Furthermore, we conclude that the effect of self-scattering has no significant impact on the observed polarization. Adopting dust-grain alignment via the radiative torque mechanism, a combination of the interstellar radiation field and the central star as radiation sources is consistent with the decrease in polarization degree at the outer regions of B335 ($\approx\,$10$^4\,$au from the core). However, the model fails to explain the low polarization degree within the inner 5000 au. ",https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202039126,2012.05889v1,No,
0000-0002-3542-2583,Niko Zielinski,Kiel University,Magnetic fields and outflows in the large Bok globule CB 54,2022,"  We have observed the large Bok globule CB 54 in 850$\mu$m polarised light using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We find that the magnetic field in the periphery of the globule shows significant, ordered deviation from the mean field direction in the globule centre. This deviation appears to correspond with the extended but relatively weak $^{12}$CO outflow emanating from the Class 0 sources at the centre of the globule. Energetics analysis suggests that if the outflow is reshaping the magnetic field in the globule's periphery, then we can place an upper limit of $<27\,\mu$G on the magnetic field strength in the globule's periphery. Comparison with archival Planck and CARMA measurements shows that the field in the centre of the globule is consistent over several orders of magnitude in size scale, and oriented parallel to the density structure in the region in projection. We thus hypothesise that while non-thermal motions in the region may be sub-Alfv\'enic, the magnetic field is subdominant to gravity over a wide range of size scales. Our results suggest that even a relatively weak outflow may be able to significantly reshape magnetic fields in star-forming regions on scales $> 0.1$ pc.

We investigate higher order corrections with an explicit control on the error terms. The Darwin order correction, order $|v/c|^2$, has been proved previously. In this contribution we obtain the dissipative corrections due to radiation damping, which are of order $|v/c|^3$ relative to the Newtonian limit.

This spurious signal is not described by the Huygens-like P-field imaging integral which assumes optical incoherence as a necessary condition to describe P-field imaging completely (as was shown by Reza etal. recently). In this paper, we estimate the relationship between the expected magnitude of this spurious signal and the degree of partial roughness within the P-field imaging system. The treatment allows us to determine the accuracy of the estimate provided by the P-field integral for varying degrees of partial coherence and allows to define a P-field signal-to-noise ratio as a figure-of-merit for the case of a partially coherent optical carrier. The study of partial coherence also enables to better relate aperture roughness to P-field noise. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2006.02600v2,No,

0000-0002-0235-0931,Sebastian Bauer,Kiel University,Staging Epileptogenesis with Deep Neural Networks,2020,"  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures accompanied by excessive synchronous brain activity. The process of structural and functional brain alterations leading to increased seizure susceptibility and eventually spontaneous seizures is called epileptogenesis (EPG) and can span months or even years. Detecting and monitoring the progression of EPG could allow for targeted early interventions that could slow down disease progression or even halt its development. Here, we propose an approach for staging EPG using deep neural networks and identify potential electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers to distinguish different phases of EPG. Specifically, continuous intracranial EEG recordings were collected from a rodent model where epilepsy is induced by electrical perforant pathway stimulation (PPS). A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to distinguish EEG signals from before stimulation (baseline), shortly after the PPS and long after the PPS but before the first spontaneous seizure (FSS). Experimental results show that our proposed method can classify EEG signals from the three phases with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, 0.89, and 0.86. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt to stage EPG prior to the FSS using DNNs. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2006.09885v1,Yes,potent(1)

One particularly important issue is the presence of secondary magnetic phases such as clusters, segregations, etc... These are often tedious to detect, leading to contradictory interpretations. We show that in our cobalt doped ZnO films grown homoepitaxially on single crystalline ZnO substrates the magnetism unambiguously stems from metallic cobalt nano-inclusions. The magnetic behavior was investigated by SQUID magnetometry, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and AC susceptibility measurements. The results were correlated to a detailed microstructural analysis based on high resolution x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electron-spectroscopic imaging. No evidence for carrier mediated ferromagnetic exchange between diluted cobalt moments was found. In contrast, the combined data provide clear evidence that the observed room temperature ferromagnetic-like behavior originates from nanometer sized superparamagnetic metallic cobalt precipitates.

0000-0002-0235-0931,Sebastian Bauer,Kiel University,Towards Early Diagnosis of Epilepsy from EEG Data,2020,"  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about 1% of the population at all ages. Detecting the development of epilepsy, i.e., epileptogenesis (EPG), before any seizures occur could allow for early interventions and potentially more effective treatments. Here, we investigate if modern machine learning (ML) techniques can detect EPG from intra-cranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings prior to the occurrence of any seizures. For this we use a rodent model of epilepsy where EPG is triggered by electrical stimulation of the brain. We propose a ML framework for EPG identification, which combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a prediction aggregation method to obtain the final classification decision. Specifically, the neural network is trained to distinguish five second segments of EEG recordings taken from either the pre-stimulation period or the post-stimulation period. Due to the gradual development of epilepsy, there is enormous overlap of the EEG patterns before and after the stimulation. Hence, a prediction aggregation process is introduced, which pools predictions over a longer period. By aggregating predictions over one hour, our approach achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 on the EPG detection task. This demonstrates the feasibility of EPG prediction from EEG recordings. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2006.06675v2,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-0235-0931,Sebastian Bauer,Kiel University,Real-time Non-line-of-Sight imaging of dynamic scenes,2020,"  Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging aims at recovering the 3D geometry of objects that are hidden from the direct line of sight. In the past, this method has suffered from the weak available multibounce signal limiting scene size, capture speed, and reconstruction quality. While algorithms capable of reconstructing scenes at several frames per second have been demonstrated, real-time NLOS video has only been demonstrated for retro-reflective objects where the NLOS signal strength is enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude or more. Furthermore, it has also been noted that the signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructions in NLOS methods drops quickly with distance and past reconstructions, therefore, have been limited to small scenes with depths of few meters. Actual models of noise and resolution in the scene have been simplistic, ignoring many of the complexities of the problem. We show that SPAD (Single-Photon Avalanche Diode) array detectors with a total of just 28 pixels combined with a specifically extended Phasor Field reconstruction algorithm can reconstruct live real-time videos of non-retro-reflective NLOS scenes. We provide an analysis of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of our reconstructions and show that for our method it is possible to reconstruct the scene such that SNR, motion blur, angular resolution, and depth resolution are all independent of scene size suggesting that reconstruction of very large scenes may be possible. In the future, the light efficiency for NLOS imaging systems can be improved further by adding more pixels to the sensor array. ",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26721-x,2010.12737v1,No,
0000-0002-0235-0931,Sebastian Bauer,Kiel University,Zinc Oxide - From Dilute Magnetic Doping to Spin Transport,2013,"  During the past years there has been renewed interest in the wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor ZnO, triggered by promising prospects for spintronic applications. First, ferromagnetism was predicted for dilute magnetic doping. In comprehensive investigation of ZnO:Co thin films based on the combined measurement of macroscopic and microscopic properties, we find no evidence for carrier-mediated itinerant ferromagnetism. Phase-pure, crystallographically excellent ZnO:Co is uniformly paramagnetic. Superparamagnetism arises when phase separation or defect formation occurs, due to nanometer-sized metallic precipitates. Other compounds like ZnO:(Li,Ni) and ZnO:Cu do not exhibit indication of ferromagnetism.   Second, its small spin-orbit coupling and correspondingly large spin coherence length makes ZnO suitable for transporting or manipulating spins in spintronic devices. From optical pump/optical probe experiments, we find a spin dephasing time of the order of 15 ns at low temperatures which we attribute to electrons bound to Al donors. In all-electrical magnetotransport measurements, we successfully create and detect a spin-polarized ensemble of electrons and transport this spin information across several nanometers. We derive a spin lifetime of 2.6 ns for these itinerant spins at low temperatures, corresponding well to results from an electrical pump/optical probe experiment.

This is done using a flexible C-arm system. Due to the X-ray immanent dimensionality reduction projecting the 3-D scene onto a 2-D image, the viewpoint is critical to guarantee an appropriate view onto the affected artery and, thus, enable reliable diagnosis. In this work we introduce an algorithm computing optimal viewpoints for the assessment of coronary arteries without the need for 3-D models. We introduce the concept of optimal viewpoint planning solely based on a single angiographic X-ray image. The subsequent viewpoint is computed such that it is rotated precisely around a vessel, while minimizing foreshortening. Our algorithm reduces foreshortening substantially compared to the input view and completely eliminates it for 90 degree rotations. Rotations around iso-centered foreshortening-free vessels passing the isocenter are exact. The precision, however, decreases when the vessel is off-centered or foreshortened. We evaluate worst case boundaries, providing insight in the maximal inaccuracies to be expected. This can be utilized to design viewpoints guaranteeing desired requirements, e.g. a true rotation around the vessel of at minimum 30 degree.

Replacing the order statistics in tail index estimators by their corresponding quantiles from the distribution function that is based on the estimated log-concave density leads to novel smooth quantile and tail index estimators. These new estimators aim at estimating the tail index especially in small samples. Acting as a smoother of the empirical distribution function, the log-concave distribution function estimator reduces estimation variability to a much greater extent than it introduces bias. As a consequence, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the smoothed version of the estimators are well superior to their non-smoothed counterparts, in terms of mean squared error.

As the datasets for this task are rather small compared to MT, we present a novel stopping criterion that prevents overfitting the BPE encoding to the training set. Additionally, we present AST BPE, which is a version of BPE that uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the SQL statement to guide BPE merges and therefore produce BPE encodings that generalize better.

A periodically driven system is naively expected to lose all memory of its initial state due to thermalization, yet this can be avoided in the presence of many-body localization. A discrete time crystal represents a driven system whose local observables spontaneously break time translation symmetry and retain memory of the initial state indefinitely. Here we report the observation of a discrete time crystal on a chain consisting of 57 superconducting qubits on a state--of--the--art quantum computer. We probe random initial states and compare the cases of vanishing and finite disorder to distinguish many-body localization from pre-thermal dynamics. We further report results on the dynamical phase transition between the discrete time crystal and a thermal regime, which is observed via critical fluctuations in the system's sub-harmonic frequency response and a significant speed-up of spin depolarisation.

We find fragmentation for strong nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor repulsions as well as for the combined case. Our results suggest that the involvement of next-nearest-neighbor repulsions leads to an increased tendency for localization. We then model the dynamics for larger systems using Markov simulations to test these findings and unveil in which interaction regimes the dynamics becomes spatially localized. In particular, we show that for strong nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions random initial states will localize provided that the density of initial movers is sufficiently low.

The question arises whether fragmentation has implications for Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the subset defined by these exactly fragmented models, in particular in the thermodynamic limit. We attempt to illuminate this issue by considering distinguishable classes of transitional behavior between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes and employing a set of numerical observables that indicate this transition. As one of these observables we present a modified inverse participation ratio (IPR) that is designed to capture the emergence of fragmented block structures. We compare this block IPR to other definitions of inverse participation ratios, as well as to the more traditional measures of level-spacing statistics and entanglement entropy. In order to resolve subtleties that arise in the numerics, we use perturbation theory around the fragmented limit as a basis for defining an effective block structure. We find that our block IPR predicts a boundary between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes that is compatible with results based on level statistics and bipartite entanglement. A scaling analysis indicates that a finite region around the exactly fragmented limit is dominated by effects of approximate fragmentation, even in the thermodynamic limit, and suggests that fragmentation constitutes a phase. We provide evidence for the universality of our approach by applying it to a different family of Hamiltonians, that features a fragmented limit due to emergent dipole conservation.

Furthermore, we investigate the existence of a weighted prefix normal form since weighted prefix normality comes with several new peculiarities that did not already occur in the binary case. We characterise these issues and finally present a standard technique to obtain a generalised prefix normal form for all words overarbitrary, finite alphabets.

Designing an algorithm for the (generally undecidable) satisfiability problem for systems of string constraints requires a thorough understanding of the structure of constraints present in the targeted cases. In this paper, we investigate benchmarks presented in the literature containing regular expression membership predicates, extract different first order logic theories, and prove their decidability, resp. undecidability. Notably, the most common theories in real-world benchmarks are PSPACE-complete and directly lead to the implementation of a more efficient algorithm to solving string constraints.

By eliminating the mechanical mode, a position-position coupling and two-mode squeezing of two cavities are induced. In the squeezing presentation, the spin-photon, magnon-photon and photon-photon coupling strengths are exponentially amplified, thus lower- and upper-branch polaritons (LBP and UBP) are generated by strongly coupled squeezed modes of two cavities. Utilizing the critical property of the LBP, the coupling between the spin qubit (magnon) and LBP is greatly enhanced, while the coupling between the spin qubit (magnon) and UBP is fully suppressed. In the dispersive regime, strong and tunable spin-magnon coupling is induced by the virtual LBP, allowing quantum state exchange between them.

By using a newly developed method for Bell-state measurement, which relies only on light homodyne detection and spin polarization measurement, near-deterministic and -perfect quantum teleportation can be achieved for large coherent-state amplitude input.

One important problem in establishing a high degree of many-body entanglement using optical techniques is the leakage of the system information via the light that creates such entanglement.

Unwanted atom-light entanglement can be removed by destructive interference of three or more successive atom-light interactions, with only the desired effective atom-atom interaction left. This quantum erasure protocol allows implementation of Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing using coherent light and a cold or warm atomic ensemble. Calculations show that significant improvement in the squeezing exceeding 10 dB is obtained compared to previous methods, and substantial spin squeezing is attainable even under moderate experimental conditions.

However, the realization of strong coupling between single NV spins is challenging. Here we propose a method to greatly enchance the interaction between two single NV spins in diamond which are only weakly coupled to an electromechanical cavity. Owing to the presence of a critical point for the linearized electromechanical subsystem, the coupling between a single NV spin and the high-frequency polariton (formed by the mechanical and cavity modes) can be fully decoupled, but the coupling between the single NV spin and the low-frequency polariton is however greatly enhanced. Thus, AC Stark shift of the single NV spin can be measured. With the low-frequency polariton as a quantum bus, a strong coupling between two single NV centers is achievable. This effective strong coupling can ensure coherent quantum-information exchange between two spin qubits in the weakly coupled spin-cavity elecromechanical system.

Therefore, seeking higher-order EPs in various quantum systems is important for quantum information science.

Then we consider the mechanical gain effect and we find that the pseudo-Hermitian COM system without $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can host both the EP3 and EP2 for symmetric and asymmetric cavities. In the symmetric case, only the EP3 or EP2 can be predicted in the parameter space, but the EP3 and EP2 can be transformed into each other by tuning the COM coupling strength in the asymmetric case. We further consider the case of one cavity with gain. For this case, the pseudo-Hermitian COM system is $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and can also host the EP3 or EP2.

We found that, under certain conditions, our method has the potential to enhance the spin-spin nonlinear interactions. We also proposed a scheme utilizing repeatedly applying the one-axis-twisting evolution to two orthogonal spin directions, which enables the transformation of the one-axis-twisting interactions into two-axis-twisting type, and therefore leads to the spin squeezing with Heisenberg-limited scaling $J^{-1}$.

The obtained light gain factor and gradient gain factor are then combined to enhance the high-frequency components. Finally, the enhanced high-frequency component is fused with the original image to achieve adaptive sharpening of the edges of WCE small intestinal villi images.

For the neutral MR, we find both two degenerate or two non-degenerate EP3s can be predicted by tuning system parameters in the parameter space, while four non-degenerate EP2s can be observed when the system parameters derivate from EP3s, which is distinguished from the previous study in the red-detuned optomechanical system.

Nowadays, the preparation of such states has mainly relied on the quadratic nonlinear dynamics. Here, we investigate the preparation of spin-spin multipartite entanglement, witnessed by quantum Fisher information, by using the cubic nonlinear dynamics. We find that, in the regime of weak coupling, the cubic scheme can greatly speed up the rate of entanglement generation as compared to the quadratic scheme (about $N$ times faster). In the strong coupling regime, the cubic nonlinear dynamics enables the periodic in time generation of a broad variety of new-type macroscopic superposition states, which allow us to realize near-Heisenberg-limit phase sensitivity. In addition, we also reveal an interesting feature that the amount of entanglement generated by the cubic scheme has a macroscopic sensitivity to the parity of $N$, which has no counterpart in quadratic nonlinear dynamics and can be exploited for sensing the parity of $N$ at the single-spin level. We also propose a new approach for a fast and high-fidelity generation of maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. By using an alternative cubic-quadratic-admixture type of nonlinear interaction, we show that one may accelerate the procedure of GHZ-state generation. The realization of the cubic nonlinear dynamics is also considered, showing that the cubic nonlinear dynamics can be realized by either repeatedly using linear- and quadratic-nonlinear dynamics or utilizing light-mediated interactions in just one step. Finally, by taking realistic imperfections into account, we find that the cubic scheme is sensitivity to the single-spin decay in the strong coupling regime, while is robust against the collective dephasing.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a highlight removal method for capsule endoscopy images. Firstly, the confidence and feature terms of the highlight region's edges are computed, where confidence is obtained by the ratio of known pixels in the RGB space's R channel to the B channel within a window centered on the highlight region's edge pixel, and feature terms are acquired by multiplying the gradient vector of the highlight region's edge pixel with the iso-intensity line. Subsequently, the confidence and feature terms are assigned different weights and summed to obtain the priority of all highlight region's edge pixels, and the pixel with the highest priority is identified. Then, the variance of the highlight region's edge pixels is used to adjust the size of the sample block window, and the best-matching block is searched in the known region based on the RGB color similarity and distance between the sample block and the window centered on the pixel with the highest priority. Finally, the pixels in the best-matching block are copied to the highest priority highlight removal region to achieve the goal of removing the highlight region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes highlights from WCE images, with a lower coefficient of variation in the highlight removal region compared to the Crinimisi algorithm and DeepGin method. Additionally, the color and texture in the highlight removal region are similar to those in the surrounding areas, and the texture is continuous. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2402.07083v2,No,

With low-frequency values in the range of a few tens of $\mathrm{fT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, the coil's inherent noise is mostly neglectable. However, frequently utilized current sources for the generation of a static magnetic bias field lead to significant low-frequency magnetic flux noise typically in the $\mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ regime. It is found that this noise cannot be decreased by increasing the coil's magnetic sensitivity, i.e. the magnetic flux density as a function of the static current.

0000-0002-0638-1663,Qinqin Tang,Kiel University,"Internet of Intelligence: A Survey on the Enabling Technologies,   Applications, and Challenges",2022,"  The Internet of intelligence is conceived as an emerging networking paradigm, which will make intelligence as easy to obtain as information. This paper provides an overview of the Internet of intelligence, focusing on motivations, architecture, enabling technologies, applications, and existing challenges. This can provide a good foundation for those who are interested to gain insights into the concept of the Internet of intelligence and the key enablers of this emerging networking paradigm. Specifically, this paper starts by investigating the evolution of networking paradigms and artificial intelligence (AI), based on which we present the motivations of the Internet of intelligence by demonstrating that networking needs intelligence and intelligence needs networking. We then present the layered architecture to characterize the Internet of intelligence systems and discuss the enabling technologies of each layer. Moreover, we discuss the critical applications and their integration with the Internet of intelligence paradigm. Finally, some technical challenges and open issues are summarized to fully exploit the benefits of the Internet of intelligence. ",https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2022.3175453,2205.08977v1,No,
