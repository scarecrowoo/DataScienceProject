0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,MetaAnchor: Learning to Detect Objects with Customized Anchors,1970,"  We propose a novel and flexible anchor mechanism named MetaAnchor for object detection frameworks. Unlike many previous detectors model anchors via a predefined manner, in MetaAnchor anchor functions could be dynamically generated from the arbitrary customized prior boxes. Taking advantage of weight prediction, MetaAnchor is able to work with most of the anchor-based object detection systems such as RetinaNet. Compared with the predefined anchor scheme, we empirically find that MetaAnchor is more robust to anchor settings and bounding box distributions; in addition, it also shows the potential on transfer tasks. Our experiment on COCO detection task shows that MetaAnchor consistently outperforms the counterparts in various scenarios.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,MAGIS: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for GitHub Issue Resolution,1970,"  In software development, resolving the emergent issues within GitHub repositories is a complex challenge that involves not only the incorporation of new code but also the maintenance of existing code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation but face difficulties in resolving Github issues, particularly at the repository level. To overcome this challenge, we empirically study the reason why LLMs fail to resolve GitHub issues and analyze the major factors. Motivated by the empirical findings, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework for GitHub Issue reSolution, MAGIS, consisting of four agents customized for software evolution: Manager, Repository Custodian, Developer, and Quality Assurance Engineer agents. This framework leverages the collaboration of various agents in the planning and coding process to unlock the potential of LLMs to resolve GitHub issues. In experiments, we employ the SWE-bench benchmark to compare MAGIS with popular LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2. MAGIS can resolve 13.94% GitHub issues, significantly outperforming the baselines. Specifically, MAGIS achieves an eight-fold increase in resolved ratio over the direct application of GPT-4, the advanced LLM.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,OpenVIS: Open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation,1970,"  Open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (OpenVIS) can simultaneously detect, segment, and track arbitrary object categories in a video, without being constrained to categories seen during training. In this work, we propose InstFormer, a carefully designed framework for the OpenVIS task that achieves powerful open-vocabulary capabilities through lightweight fine-tuning with limited-category data. InstFormer begins with the open-world mask proposal network, encouraged to propose all potential instance class-agnostic masks by the contrastive instance margin loss. Next, we introduce InstCLIP, adapted from pre-trained CLIP with Instance Guidance Attention, which encodes open-vocabulary instance tokens efficiently. These instance tokens not only enable open-vocabulary classification but also offer strong universal tracking capabilities. Furthermore, to prevent the tracking module from being constrained by the training data with limited categories, we propose the universal rollout association, which transforms the tracking problem into predicting the next frame's instance tracking token. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed InstFormer achieve state-of-the-art capabilities on a comprehensive OpenVIS evaluation benchmark, while also achieves competitive performance in fully supervised VIS task.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,Plug-and-Play Feature Generation for Few-Shot Medical Image   Classification,1970,"  Few-shot learning (FSL) presents immense potential in enhancing model generalization and practicality for medical image classification with limited training data; however, it still faces the challenge of severe overfitting in classifier training due to distribution bias caused by the scarce training samples. To address the issue, we propose MedMFG, a flexible and lightweight plug-and-play method designed to generate sufficient class-distinctive features from limited samples. Specifically, MedMFG first re-represents the limited prototypes to assign higher weights for more important information features. Then, the prototypes are variationally generated into abundant effective features. Finally, the generated features and prototypes are together to train a more generalized classifier. Experiments demonstrate that MedMFG outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain benchmarks involving the transition from natural images to medical images, as well as medical images with different lesions. Notably, our method achieves over 10% performance improvement compared to several baselines. Fusion experiments further validate the adaptability of MedMFG, as it seamlessly integrates into various backbones and baselines, consistently yielding improvements of over 2.9% across all results.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,Towards Practical Certifiable Patch Defense with Vision Transformer,1970,"  Patch attacks, one of the most threatening forms of physical attack in adversarial examples, can lead networks to induce misclassification by modifying pixels arbitrarily in a continuous region. Certifiable patch defense can guarantee robustness that the classifier is not affected by patch attacks. Existing certifiable patch defenses sacrifice the clean accuracy of classifiers and only obtain a low certified accuracy on toy datasets. Furthermore, the clean and certified accuracy of these methods is still significantly lower than the accuracy of normal classification networks, which limits their application in practice. To move towards a practical certifiable patch defense, we introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) into the framework of Derandomized Smoothing (DS). Specifically, we propose a progressive smoothed image modeling task to train Vision Transformer, which can capture the more discriminable local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. For efficient inference and deployment in the real world, we innovatively reconstruct the global self-attention structure of the original ViT into isolated band unit self-attention. On ImageNet, under 2% area patch attacks our method achieves 41.70% certified accuracy, a nearly 1-fold increase over the previous best method (26.00%). Simultaneously, our method achieves 78.58% clean accuracy, which is quite close to the normal ResNet-101 accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art clean and certified accuracy with inferring efficiently on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in   Text-to-Image Synthesis,1970,"  Well-designed prompts have demonstrated the potential to guide text-to-image models in generating amazing images. Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,PG-Attack: A Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack Framework Against   Vision Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving,1970,"  Vision foundation models are increasingly employed in autonomous driving systems due to their advanced capabilities. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1. Additionally, we won First-Place in the CVPR 2024 Workshop Challenge: Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Vision Foundation Models and codes are available at https://github.com/fuhaha824/PG-Attack.

This review explores the latest developments and challenges in MLMs, emphasizing their potential in achieving artificial general intelligence and as a pathway to world models. We provide an overview of key techniques such as Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-COT), Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), and Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL). Additionally, we discuss both the fundamental and specific technologies of multimodal models, highlighting their applications, input/output modalities, and design characteristics. Despite significant advancements, the development of a unified multimodal model remains elusive. We discuss the integration of 3D generation and embodied intelligence to enhance world simulation capabilities and propose incorporating external rule systems for improved reasoning and decision-making. Finally, we outline future research directions to address these challenges and advance the field.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,Efficient Decision-based Black-box Patch Attacks on Video Recognition,1970,"  Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance, they are vulnerable to adversarial patches that introduce perceptible and localized perturbations to the input. Generating adversarial patches on images has received much attention, while adversarial patches on videos have not been well investigated. Further, decision-based attacks, where attackers only access the predicted hard labels by querying threat models, have not been well explored on video models either, even if they are practical in real-world video recognition scenes. The absence of such studies leads to a huge gap in the robustness assessment for video models. To bridge this gap, this work first explores decision-based patch attacks on video models. We analyze that the huge parameter space brought by videos and the minimal information returned by decision-based models both greatly increase the attack difficulty and query burden. To achieve a query-efficient attack, we propose a spatial-temporal differential evolution (STDE) framework. First, STDE introduces target videos as patch textures and only adds patches on keyframes that are adaptively selected by temporal difference. Second, STDE takes minimizing the patch area as the optimization objective and adopts spatialtemporal mutation and crossover to search for the global optimum without falling into the local optimum. Experiments show STDE has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in terms of threat, efficiency and imperceptibility. Hence, STDE has the potential to be a powerful tool for evaluating the robustness of video recognition models.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,TagOOD: A Novel Approach to Out-of-Distribution Detection via   Vision-Language Representations and Class Center Learning,1970,"  Multimodal fusion, leveraging data like vision and language, is rapidly gaining traction. This enriched data representation improves performance across various tasks. Existing methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a critical area where AI models encounter unseen data in real-world scenarios, rely heavily on whole-image features. These image-level features can include irrelevant information that hinders the detection of OOD samples, ultimately limiting overall performance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TagOOD}, a novel approach for OOD detection that leverages vision-language representations to achieve label-free object feature decoupling from whole images. This decomposition enables a more focused analysis of object semantics, enhancing OOD detection performance. Subsequently, TagOOD trains a lightweight network on the extracted object features to learn representative class centers. These centers capture the central tendencies of IND object classes, minimizing the influence of irrelevant image features during OOD detection. Finally, our approach efficiently detects OOD samples by calculating distance-based metrics as OOD scores between learned centers and test samples. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TagOOD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing OOD detection methods. This work presents a novel perspective for further exploration of multimodal information utilization in OOD detection, with potential applications across various tasks.

To address this, we transform Affective Forecasting into a Deep Learning problem by designing an Emotion Forecasting paradigm based on two-party interactions. We propose a novel Emotion Forecasting (EF) task grounded in the theory that an individuals emotions are easily influenced by the emotions or other information conveyed during interactions with another person. To tackle this task, we have developed a specialized dataset, Human-interaction-based Emotion Forecasting (Hi-EF), which contains 3069 two-party Multilayered-Contextual Interaction Samples (MCIS) with abundant affective-relevant labels and three modalities. Hi-EF not only demonstrates the feasibility of the EF task but also highlights its potential. Additionally, we propose a methodology that establishes a foundational and referential baseline model for the EF task and extensive experiments are provided.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement with   Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution,1970,"  Pre-trained diffusion models utilized for image generation encapsulate a substantial reservoir of a priori knowledge pertaining to intricate textures. Harnessing the potential of leveraging this a priori knowledge in the context of image super-resolution presents a compelling avenue. Nonetheless, prevailing diffusion-based methodologies presently overlook the constraints imposed by degradation information on the diffusion process. Furthermore, these methods fail to consider the spatial variability inherent in the estimated blur kernel, stemming from factors such as motion jitter and out-of-focus elements in open-environment scenarios. This oversight results in a notable deviation of the image super-resolution effect from fundamental realities. To address these concerns, we introduce a framework known as Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of \textbf{S}patially Variant Kernel Refinement with Diffusion Model for Blind Image \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution (SSR). Within the SSR framework, we propose a Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement (SVKR) module. SVKR estimates a Depth-Informed Kernel, which takes the depth information into account and is spatially variant. Additionally, SVKR enhance the accuracy of depth information acquired from LR images, allowing for mutual enhancement between the depth map and blur kernel estimates. Finally, we introduce the Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion (AMF) module to align the information from three modalities: low-resolution images, depth maps, and blur kernels. This alignment can constrain the diffusion model to generate more authentic SR results.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,Seeking Certainty In Uncertainty: Dual-Stage Unified Framework Solving   Uncertainty in Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition,1970,"  The contemporary state-of-the-art of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) technology facilitates remarkable progress by deriving emotional mappings of facial expressions from video content, underpinned by training on voluminous datasets. Yet, the DFER datasets encompass a substantial volume of noise data. Noise arises from low-quality captures that defy logical labeling, and instances that suffer from mislabeling due to annotation bias, engendering two principal types of uncertainty: the uncertainty regarding data usability and the uncertainty concerning label reliability. Addressing the two types of uncertainty, we have meticulously crafted a two-stage framework aiming at \textbf{S}eeking \textbf{C}ertain data \textbf{I}n extensive \textbf{U}ncertain data (SCIU). This initiative aims to purge the DFER datasets of these uncertainties, thereby ensuring that only clean, verified data is employed in training processes. To mitigate the issue of low-quality samples, we introduce the Coarse-Grained Pruning (CGP) stage, which assesses sample weights and prunes those deemed unusable due to their low weight. For samples with incorrect annotations, the Fine-Grained Correction (FGC) stage evaluates prediction stability to rectify mislabeled data. Moreover, SCIU is conceived as a universally compatible, plug-and-play framework, tailored to integrate seamlessly with prevailing DFER methodologies. Rigorous experiments across prevalent DFER datasets and against numerous benchmark methods substantiates SCIU's capacity to markedly elevate performance metrics.

0000-0002-8364-0876,Wenqiang Zhang,Tsinghua University,A Survey on Facial Expression Recognition of Static and Dynamic Emotions,1970,"  Facial expression recognition (FER) aims to analyze emotional states from static images and dynamic sequences, which is pivotal in enhancing anthropomorphic communication among humans, robots, and digital avatars by leveraging AI technologies. As the FER field evolves from controlled laboratory environments to more complex in-the-wild scenarios, advanced methods have been rapidly developed and new challenges and apporaches are encounted, which are not well addressed in existing reviews of FER. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of both image-based static FER (SFER) and video-based dynamic FER (DFER) methods, analyzing from model-oriented development to challenge-focused categorization. We begin with a critical comparison of recent reviews, an introduction to common datasets and evaluation criteria, and an in-depth workflow on FER to establish a robust research foundation. We then systematically review representative approaches addressing eight main challenges in SFER (such as expression disturbance, uncertainties, compound emotions, and cross-domain inconsistency) as well as seven main challenges in DFER (such as key frame sampling, expression intensity variations, and cross-modal alignment). Additionally, we analyze recent advancements, benchmark performances, major applications, and ethical considerations.

0000-0002-1478-3232,Lingting Zhu,The University of Hong Kong,Make-A-Volume: Leveraging Latent Diffusion Models for Cross-Modality 3D   Brain MRI Synthesis,1970,"  Cross-modality medical image synthesis is a critical topic and has the potential to facilitate numerous applications in the medical imaging field. Despite recent successes in deep-learning-based generative models, most current medical image synthesis methods rely on generative adversarial networks and suffer from notorious mode collapse and unstable training. Moreover, the 2D backbone-driven approaches would easily result in volumetric inconsistency, while 3D backbones are challenging and impractical due to the tremendous memory cost and training difficulty. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for volumetric medical data synthesis by leveraging 2D backbones and present a diffusion-based framework, Make-A-Volume, for cross-modality 3D medical image synthesis. To learn the cross-modality slice-wise mapping, we employ a latent diffusion model and learn a low-dimensional latent space, resulting in high computational efficiency. To enable the 3D image synthesis and mitigate volumetric inconsistency, we further insert a series of volumetric layers in the 2D slice-mapping model and fine-tune them with paired 3D data. This paradigm extends the 2D image diffusion model to a volumetric version with a slightly increasing number of parameters and computation, offering a principled solution for generic cross-modality 3D medical image synthesis. We showcase the effectiveness of our Make-A-Volume framework on an in-house SWI-MRA brain MRI dataset and a public T1-T2 brain MRI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior synthesis results with volumetric consistency.

0000-0002-1478-3232,Lingting Zhu,The University of Hong Kong,Generative Enhancement for 3D Medical Images,1970,"  The limited availability of 3D medical image datasets, due to privacy concerns and high collection or annotation costs, poses significant challenges in the field of medical imaging. While a promising alternative is the use of synthesized medical data, there are few solutions for realistic 3D medical image synthesis due to difficulties in backbone design and fewer 3D training samples compared to 2D counterparts. In this paper, we propose GEM-3D, a novel generative approach to the synthesis of 3D medical images and the enhancement of existing datasets using conditional diffusion models. Our method begins with a 2D slice, noted as the informed slice to serve the patient prior, and propagates the generation process using a 3D segmentation mask. By decomposing the 3D medical images into masks and patient prior information, GEM-3D offers a flexible yet effective solution for generating versatile 3D images from existing datasets. GEM-3D can enable dataset enhancement by combining informed slice selection and generation at random positions, along with editable mask volumes to introduce large variations in diffusion sampling. Moreover, as the informed slice contains patient-wise information, GEM-3D can also facilitate counterfactual image synthesis and dataset-level de-enhancement with desired control. Experiments on brain MRI and abdomen CT images demonstrate that GEM-3D is capable of synthesizing high-quality 3D medical images with volumetric consistency, offering a straightforward solution for dataset enhancement during inference.

Additionally, fullduplex (FD) technology is recognized as a potent approach for enhancing spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception within the same time and frequency resources. In this study, we investigate the performance of a STAR-RIS-assisted FD communication system. The STAR-RIS is strategically placed at the cell-edge to facilitate communication for users located in this challenging region, while cell-center users can communicate directly with the FD base station (BS). We employ a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) pairing scheme and account for system impairments, such as self-interference at the BS and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). We derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic rates in both the up-link and down-link communications and extend our analysis to bidirectional communication between cell-center and cell-edge users. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the ergodic sum-rate. This optimization involves adjusting the amplitudes and phase-shifts of the STAR-RIS elements and allocating total transmit power efficiently. To gain deeper insights into the achievable rates of STAR-RIS-aided FD systems, we explore the impact of various system parameters through numerical results.

The best performing materials are ferroelectrics at a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), where several phases can intimately coexist. Switching between these phases by electric field produces a large electromechanical response. In the ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$, strain can be used to create an MPB-like phase mixture and thus to generate large electric field dependent strains. However, this enhanced response occurs at localized, randomly positioned regions of the film, which potentially complicates nanodevice design. Here, we use epitaxial strain and orientation engineering in tandem - anisotropic epitaxy - to craft a hitherto unavailable low-symmetry phase of BiFeO$_3$ which acts as a structural bridge between the rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like polymorphs. Interferometric displacement sensor measurements and first-principle calculations reveal that under external electric bias, this phase undergoes a transition to the tetragonal-like polymorph, generating a piezoelectric response enhanced by over 200%, and associated giant field-induced reversible strain. These results offer a new route to engineer giant electromechanical properties in thin films, with broader perspectives for other functional oxide systems.

0000-0001-7224-9954,Yangyang Zhang,"Peking University, Peking University First Hospital",Token-Mol 1.0: Tokenized drug design with large language model,1970,"  Significant interests have recently risen in leveraging sequence-based large language models (LLMs) for drug design. However, most current applications of LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D) structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods. Token-Mol overcomes the precision limitations of token-only models and has the potential to integrate seamlessly with general models such as ChatGPT, paving the way for the development of a universal artificial intelligence drug design model that facilitates rapid and high-quality drug design by experts.

Non-degenerate ground state of the matrix directly predicts the ergodicity of simulation data. The ground state could be adopted as statistical weights of trajectories to correctly reconstruct the equilibrium properties, even though each trajectory only explores part of the conformational space. Otherwise, the degree of degeneracy simply gives the number of meta-stable states of the system under the time scale of individual trajectory. Manipulation on the eigenvectors leads to the classification of trajectories into non-transition ones within the states and transition ones between them. The transition states may also be predicted without a priori knowledge of the system.

Meanwhile, the antagonism or cooperation of individuals presented by the network topology also evolve according to the dynamic opinion distances. Opinions are convergent and the stable state will be reached in this co-evolution mechanism. We further explored this framework through simulation experiments.

We analyzed a large-scale dataset of over 20 million clicks from more than 4,000 mobile users who opted in. We then designed a deep learning model that predicts the next element that the user clicks given the user's click history, the structural information of the UI screen, and the current context such as the time of the day. We thoroughly investigated the deep model by comparing it with a set of baseline methods based on the dataset. The experiments show that our model achieves 48% and 71% accuracy (top-1 and top-3) for predicting next clicks based on a held-out dataset of test users, which significantly outperformed all the baseline methods with a large margin. We discussed a few scenarios for integrating the model in mobile interaction and how users can potentially benefit from the model.

Furthermore, the cellular structures are symmetrical with hexagonal, pentagonal and square cellular patterns where the cellular size is only around 1{\mu}m. Single-layer and bulk 316L SLM experiments are presented that reveals the forming mechanism of these sub-grain cellular microstructures. Complex cellular sub-micron patterns were formed by the local convection and B\'enard Instabilities in front of the solid/liquid (S/L) interface (so-called mushy zones) affected by intricate temperature and surface tension gradients. In other words, this nonlinear self-organization phenomenon (B\'enard Instability) occurring at the S/L interface is superimposed on the macro-grain solidification process to form the sub-grain patterns/structures and elemental microsegregations. This simple and unified explanation can be expanded to other eutectic alloys formed by SLM, like the Al-Si system.

It provides a particularly useful framework to model growth trend in longitudinal data. However, the estimation and inference of GCM with a large number of response variables faces numerous challenges, and remains underdeveloped. In this article, we study the high-dimensional multivariate-response linear GCM, and develop the corresponding estimation and inference procedures. Our proposal is far from a straightforward extension, and involves several innovative components. Specifically, we introduce a Kronecker product structure, which allows us to effectively decompose a very large covariance matrix, and to pool the correlated samples to improve the estimation accuracy. We devise a highly non-trivial multi-step estimation approach to estimate the individual covariance components separately and effectively. We also develop rigorous statistical inference procedures to test both the global effects and the individual effects, and establish the size and power properties, as well as the proper false discovery control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method through both intensive simulations, and the analysis of a longitudinal neuroimaging data for Alzheimer's disease.

Numerous recent studies have investigated the application of LLMs to enhance vulnerability detection and repair tasks. Despite the increasing research interest, there is currently no existing survey that focuses on the utilization of LLMs for vulnerability detection and repair. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by offering a systematic literature review of approaches aimed at improving vulnerability detection and repair through the utilization of LLMs. The review encompasses research work from leading SE, AI, and Security conferences and journals, covering 36 papers published at 21 distinct venues. By answering three key research questions, we aim to (1) summarize the LLMs employed in the relevant literature, (2) categorize various LLM adaptation techniques in vulnerability detection, and (3) classify various LLM adaptation techniques in vulnerability repair. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of challenges that still need to be tackled considering existing studies.

Deploying DNN models at edge nodes, closer to end users, reduces inference delay and minimizes bandwidth costs. However, these resource-constrained edge nodes may experience substantial delays under heavy workloads, leading to imbalanced workload distribution. While previous efforts focused on optimizing hierarchical device-edge-cloud architectures or centralized clusters for video analytics, we propose addressing these challenges through collaborative distributed and autonomous edge nodes. Despite the intricate control involved, we introduce EdgeVision, a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)- based framework for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. EdgeVision enables edge nodes to autonomously learn policies for video preprocessing, model selection, and request dispatching. Our approach utilizes an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm enhanced with an attention mechanism to learn optimal policies. To validate EdgeVision, we construct a multi-edge testbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets.

Compressing images using extremely low bitrates (<0.1 bpp) has been studied but it often results in low quality images of heavy artifacts due to the strong constraint in the number of bits available for the compressed data. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words but on the other hand, language is very powerful in capturing the essence of an image using short descriptions. With the recent success of diffusion models for text-to-image generation, we propose a generative image compression method that demonstrates the potential of saving an image as a short text embedding which in turn can be used to generate high-fidelity images which is equivalent to the original one perceptually. For a given image, its corresponding text embedding is learned using the same optimization process as the text-to-image diffusion model itself, using a learnable text embedding as input after bypassing the original transformer. The optimization is applied together with a learning compression model to achieve extreme compression of low bitrates <0.1 bpp. Based on our experiments measured by a comprehensive set of image quality metrics, our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of both perceptual quality and diversity.

Most existing recommendation methods focus on capturing users' personalized preferences through historical user-item interactions, which may potentially violate user privacy. Additionally, these approaches often overlook the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems. Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial applications and a valuable baseline for future research.

0000-0002-4048-4017,Xin Zhou,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented   Code Search,1970,"  In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing stylistic nuances. The source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Alex-HaochenLi/ReCo}.

0000-0002-4048-4017,Xin Zhou,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Are ID Embeddings Necessary? Whitening Pre-trained Text Embeddings for   Effective Sequential Recommendation,1970,"  Recent sequential recommendation models have combined pre-trained text embeddings of items with item ID embeddings to achieve superior recommendation performance. Despite their effectiveness, the expressive power of text features in these models remains largely unexplored. While most existing models emphasize the importance of ID embeddings in recommendations, our study takes a step further by studying sequential recommendation models that only rely on text features and do not necessitate ID embeddings. Upon examining pretrained text embeddings experimentally, we discover that they reside in an anisotropic semantic space, with an average cosine similarity of over 0.8 between items. We also demonstrate that this anisotropic nature hinders recommendation models from effectively differentiating between item representations and leads to degenerated performance. To address this issue, we propose to employ a pre-processing step known as whitening transformation, which transforms the anisotropic text feature distribution into an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Our experiments show that whitening pre-trained text embeddings in the sequential model can significantly improve recommendation performance. However, the full whitening operation might break the potential manifold of items with similar text semantics. To preserve the original semantics while benefiting from the isotropy of the whitened text features, we introduce WhitenRec+, an ensemble approach that leverages both fully whitened and relaxed whitened item representations for effective recommendations. We further discuss and analyze the benefits of our design through experiments and proofs. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that WhitenRec+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation.

Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.

As highly rated online services usually receive substantial revenue in the markets, malicious sellers seek to boost their service evaluation by manipulating the rating system with fake ratings. One effective way to improve the service evaluation is to hire fake rating providers by bribery. The fake ratings given by the bribed buyers influence the evaluation of the service, which further impacts the decision-making of potential buyers. In this paper, we study the bribery of a rating system with multiple sellers and buyers via a game-theoretic perspective. In detail, we examine whether there exists an equilibrium state in the market in which the rating system is expected to be bribery-proof: no bribery strategy yields a strictly positive gain. We first collect real-world data for modeling the bribery problem in rating systems. On top of that, we analyze the problem of bribery in a rating system as a static game. From our analysis, we conclude that at least a Nash equilibrium can be reached in the bribery game of rating systems.

Nevertheless, existing DL-based vulnerability repair methods face notable limitations: 1) they struggle to handle lengthy vulnerable code, 2) they treat code as natural language texts, neglecting its inherent structure, and 3) they do not tap into the valuable expert knowledge present in the expert system.   To address this, we propose VulMaster, a Transformer-based neural network model that excels at generating vulnerability repairs through data-centric innovation. Specifically, VulMaster introduces the utilization and combination of various types of input data, including complete vulnerable code of any size, vulnerable code structures, and expert knowledge from the CWE system. Additionally, VulMaster leverages the collaboration between two Large Language Models (LLMs), CodeT5 and ChatGPT: CodeT5 acts as the customizable backbone LLM, fine-tuned with the training data, while ChatGPT supplements by providing missing relevant inputs to CodeT5. We evaluated VulMaster on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset comprising 1,754 projects with 5,800 vulnerable functions. The experimental results demonstrated that VulMaster exhibits substantial improvements compared to the learning-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approach.

In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting in significant penalties and immeasurable reputation and economic loss.

It pulls together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications. 2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less ``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE. Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of proposed loss functions with other design alternatives.

For example, even safety-aligned LLMs can be easily fine-tuned into harmful assistants as the fine-tuning data often contains implicit or explicit harmful content. Can we train LLMs on harmful data without learning harmful behaviors? This paper proposes a controllable training framework that makes harmful behaviors unlearnable during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce ``security vectors'', a few new parameters that can be separated from the LLM, to ensure LLM's responses are consistent with the harmful behavior. Security vectors are activated during fine-tuning, the consistent behavior makes LLM believe that such behavior has already been learned, there is no need to further optimize for harmful data. During inference, we can deactivate security vectors to restore the LLM's normal behavior. The experimental results show that the security vectors generated by 100 harmful samples are enough to prevent LLM from learning 1000 harmful samples, while preserving the ability to learn other useful information.

0000-0002-4048-4017,Xin Zhou,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Discovery of an old supernova remnant candidate through carbon monoxide   line emission,1970,"  Most old supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way have not yet been identified. Considering their large potential number and the sufficient momentum-energy transfer to the interstellar medium (ISM), they are a key part of our understanding of the overall role of SNRs in the ISM. Here we report our discovery of an expanding molecular shell identified by CO line observations, namely G16.11-0.51. It covers a known SNR, specifically G16.0-0.5, and is larger in size, i.e. 0.56 deg over 0.20 deg. Based on its spatial and kinematic structures, weak nonthermal radio-continuum emission, and derived physical properties, we suggest that it is an old SNR. At a systemic velocity of +41.3 km s^-1, the best estimated kinematic distance of G16.11-0.51 is ~3.2 kpc, implying its radius of about 15.6 pc. The age of G16.11-0.51 is estimated to be greater than ~10^5 yr, and, in a dense molecular environment, it has formed dense and thin shell layers. The kinetic energy of the expanding molecular gas of G16.11-0.51 is about 6.4x10^49 erg, accounting for approximately six percent of the initial SN explosion energy. Although old SNRs have essentially become cold and hard to detect, our discovery suggests that they can be found by searching for CO line emissions.

Translating these high-level design goals into concrete design mock-ups, however, requires extensive effort and UI design expertise. To facilitate this process for app designers and developers, we introduce three deep-learning techniques to create low-fidelity UI mock-ups from a natural language phrase that describes the high-level design goal (e.g. ""pop up displaying an image and other options""). In particular, we contribute two retrieval-based methods and one generative method, as well as pre-processing and post-processing techniques to ensure the quality of the created UI mock-ups. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare and contrast each method's ability in suggesting coherent, diverse and relevant UI design mock-ups. We further evaluate these methods with 15 professional UI designers and practitioners to understand each method's advantages and disadvantages. The designers responded positively to the potential of these methods for assisting the design process.

We present Screen2Words, a novel screen summarization approach that automatically encapsulates essential information of a UI screen into a coherent language phrase. Summarizing mobile screens requires a holistic understanding of the multi-modal data of mobile UIs, including text, image, structures as well as UI semantics, motivating our multi-modal learning approach.

We then experimented with a set of deep models with different configurations.

However, when applied to token-level labeling tasks such as NER, it would be time-consuming to enumerate the template queries over all potential entity spans. In this work, we propose a more elegant method to reformulate NER tasks as LM problems without any templates. Specifically, we discard the template construction process while maintaining the word prediction paradigm of pre-training models to predict a class-related pivot word (or label word) at the entity position. Meanwhile, we also explore principled ways to automatically search for appropriate label words that the pre-trained models can easily adapt to. While avoiding complicated template-based process, the proposed LM objective also reduces the gap between different objectives used in pre-training and fine-tuning, thus it can better benefit the few-shot performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over bert-tagger and template-based method under few-shot setting. Moreover, the decoding speed of the proposed method is up to 1930.12 times faster than the template-based method.

Prior work on rendering bokeh effects have focused on post hoc image manipulation to produce similar blurring effects in existing photographs using classical computer graphics or neural rendering techniques, but have either depth discontinuity artifacts or are restricted to reproducing bokeh effects that are present in the training data. More recent diffusion based models can synthesize images with an artistic style, but either require the generation of high-dimensional masks, expensive fine-tuning, or affect global image characteristics. In this paper, we present GBSD, the first generative text-to-image model that synthesizes photorealistic images with a bokeh style. Motivated by how image synthesis occurs progressively in diffusion models, our approach combines latent diffusion models with a 2-stage conditioning algorithm to render bokeh effects on semantically defined objects. Since we can focus the effect on objects, this semantic bokeh effect is more versatile than classical rendering techniques. We evaluate GBSD both quantitatively and qualitatively and demonstrate its ability to be applied in both text-to-image and image-to-image settings.

In this study, we performed temperature-dependent resistivity measurements on the synthesized Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O samples. The structure of the sample was confirmed to match the reference literature through X-ray diffraction analysis. Remarkably, we observed four distinct types of resistivity behaviors within samples from the same pellet: (1) A semiconductor-like behavior characterized by a decrease in resistivity as the temperature is lowered. (2) A gradual reduction in resistivity, reaching an exceptionally small value that falls below the resolution limits of our measurement equipment. (3) An abrupt drop in resistivity to a low value at ~ 250 K. (4) An almost linear reduction in resistivity exhibiting a transition at approximately 7 K (possibly associated with Pb). Following a thorough compositional analysis, we proposed a current percolation model, based on the formation of a Cu/Pb current channel, to elucidate the observed special resistivity behaviors. It is important to note that the Meissner effect was not observed in our magnetization measurements. Consequently, we reached the conclusion that the presence of superconductivity in Cu-doped Apatite has yet to be substantiated.

While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored In-Context Learning (ICL) as a strategy to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL introduces inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs under the automated code generation scenario. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL across a diverse set of LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate the extended capabilities of PEFT, showcasing its ability to learn from two distinct datasets jointly without compromising performance. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/martin-wey/peft-llm-code/.

Existing approaches that integrate LLMs and KGs either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to tight coupling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative framework named EffiQA that can strike a balance between performance and efficiency via an iterative paradigm. EffiQA consists of three stages: global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection. Specifically, EffiQA leverages the commonsense capability of LLMs to explore potential reasoning pathways through global planning. Then, it offloads semantic pruning to a small plug-in model for efficient KG exploration. Finally, the exploration results are fed to LLMs for self-reflection to further improve the global planning and efficient KG exploration. Empirical evidence on multiple KBQA benchmarks shows EffiQA's effectiveness, achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs. We hope the proposed new framework will pave the way for efficient, knowledge-intensive querying by redefining the integration of LLMs and KGs, fostering future research on knowledge-based question answering.

The design idea of the dual circulation mode with two-sided field mirrors is elaborated in detail with the example of MMC based on dual Pickett Bradley White cell (PBWC), and the simple design methods of the other three MMCs based on the dual circulation mode of PBWC and Bernstein Herzberg White cell (BHWC) are given. Further, we propose a general design method for ultra-long OPL MMCs with multi-cycle mode by adding cyclic elements. The OPL of the MMCs designed by this method can reach the order of kilometers or even tens of kilometers. The novel MMCs have the advantages of simple structure, strong spot formation regularity, easy expansion, high mirror utilization ratio, high reuse times of spot spatial position, good stability and extremely high ratio of the optical path length to the volume (RLV). In order to evaluate the performance of the new MMCs, an open-path methane gas sensor with the MMC based on triple PBWC was constructed, which was used to continuously measure the methane in the laboratory, and the feasibility, effectiveness and practicability of the new design method were verified. The design method proposed in this paper provides a new idea for the design of multipass cell (MPC), and the new MMCs designed have great potential application value in the field of high-precision trace gas monitoring.

However, collecting and executing speech test cases is usually expensive and time-consuming, motivating us to strategically prioritize speech test cases. A key question is: how to determine the ideal order of collecting and executing speech test cases to uncover more errors as early as possible? Each speech test case consists of a piece of audio and the corresponding reference text. In this work, we propose PROPHET (PRiOritizing sPeecH tEsT), a tool that predicts potential error-uncovering speech test cases only based on their reference texts. Thus, PROPHET analyzes test cases and prioritizes them without running the ASR system, which can analyze speech test cases at a large scale. We evaluate 6 different prioritization methods on 3 ASR systems and 12 datasets. Given the same testing budget, we find that our approach uncovers 12.63% more wrongly recognized words than the state-of-the-art method. We select test cases from the prioritized list to fine-tune ASR systems and analyze how our approach can improve the ASR system performance. Statistical tests show that our proposed method can bring significantly larger performance improvement to ASR systems than the existing baseline methods. Furthermore, we perform correlation analysis and confirm that fine-tuning an ASR system using a dataset, on which the model performs worse, tends to improve the performance more.

0000-0002-4048-4017,Xin Zhou,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",On the Usage of Continual Learning for Out-of-Distribution   Generalization in Pre-trained Language Models of Code,1970,"  Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become a prevalent technique in deep learning for code, utilizing a two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning procedure to acquire general knowledge about code and specialize in a variety of downstream tasks. However, the dynamic nature of software codebases poses a challenge to the effectiveness and robustness of PLMs. In particular, world-realistic scenarios potentially lead to significant differences between the distribution of the pre-training and test data, i.e., distribution shift, resulting in a degradation of the PLM's performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we stress the need for adapting PLMs of code to software data whose distribution changes over time, a crucial problem that has been overlooked in previous works. The motivation of this work is to consider the PLM in a non-stationary environment, where fine-tuning data evolves over time according to a software evolution scenario. Specifically, we design a scenario where the model needs to learn from a stream of programs containing new, unseen APIs over time. We study two widely used PLM architectures, i.e., a GPT2 decoder and a RoBERTa encoder, on two downstream tasks, API call and API usage prediction. We demonstrate that the most commonly used fine-tuning technique from prior work is not robust enough to handle the dynamic nature of APIs, leading to the loss of previously acquired knowledge i.e., catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we implement five continual learning approaches, including replay-based and regularization-based methods. Our findings demonstrate that utilizing these straightforward methods effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in PLMs across both downstream tasks while achieving comparable or superior performance.

Our proposed Diff3Det migrates the diffusion model to proposal generation for 3D object detection by considering the detection boxes as generative targets. During training, the object boxes diffuse from the ground truth boxes to the Gaussian distribution, and the decoder learns to reverse this noise process. In the inference stage, the model progressively refines a set of random boxes to the prediction results.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models.

Studies indicate that assigning LLMs the roles of experts, a strategy known as role-play prompting, can enhance their performance in the corresponding domains. However, the prompt needs to be manually designed for the given problem, requiring certain expertise and iterative modifications. To this end, we propose self-prompt tuning, making LLMs themselves generate role-play prompts through fine-tuning. Leveraging the LIMA dataset as our foundational corpus, we employ GPT-4 to annotate role-play prompts for each data points, resulting in the creation of the LIMA-Role dataset. We then fine-tune LLMs like Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B on LIMA-Role. Consequently, the self-prompt tuned LLMs can automatically generate expert role prompts for any given question. We extensively evaluate self-prompt tuned LLMs on widely used NLP benchmarks and open-ended question test.

There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection. On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries. On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection. However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.

The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives. By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.

We present multi-wavelength observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and the H II region G159.2+3.3 apparently projected nearby, in order to study their properties and potential physical connections. Results. HB9 is bright in $\gamma$-rays, but the $\gamma$-ray morphology is centrally filled and most of it is not clearly associated with the surrounding molecular clouds. There is a weak apparent connection of HB9 to the IR bright enclosing shell of G159.2+3.3 in $\gamma$-ray. The diffuse Balmer line has almost identical morphology as the radio emission in G159.2+3.3, indicating they two are thermal in origin. Using medium-band high-resolution optical spectra from selected regions of the southeast (SE) shell of HB9 and G159.2+3.3, we found the radial velocity dispersion of HB9 along the slit is significantly higher than the FWHM of the lines. In contrast, these two values are both smaller and comparable to each other in G159.2+3.3. This indicates that the gas in HB9 may have additional global motion triggered by the SNR shock. The [N II] $\lambda$6583A/H$\alpha$ line ratio of both objects can be interpreted with photo-ionisation by hot stars or low velocity shocks, except for the post-shock region in the SE shell of HB9, where the elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggests contribution from shock ionisation. The measured electron density from the [S II] 6716/6730 line ratio is significantly lower in the brighter G159.2+3.3 compared to the SE shell of HB9. Conclusions. Our density estimate suggests that G159.2+3.3, although appearing brighter and more compact, is likely located at a much larger distance than HB9, so the two objects have no physical connections, unless the shock compressed gas in HB9 has a significantly lower filling factor.

However, the inherent NP-hardness of this problem significantly complicates the matter. The prohibitive time complexity of existing algorithms is the primary bottleneck constraining the application scenarios. Aiming to address this challenge, we present an unprecedented exploration of a quantum computing approach. Efficient quantum algorithms, as a crucial future direction for handling NP-hard problems, are presently under intensive investigation, of which the potential has already been proven in practical arenas such as cybersecurity. However, in the field of quantum algorithms for graph databases, little work has been done due to the challenges presented by the quantum representation of complex graph topologies. In this study, we delve into the intricacies of encoding a bipartite graph on a quantum computer. Given a bipartite graph with n vertices, we propose a ground-breaking algorithm qMBS with time complexity O^*(2^(n/2)), illustrating a quadratic speed-up in terms of complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we detail two variants tailored for the maximum vertex biclique problem and the maximum balanced biclique problem. To corroborate the practical performance and efficacy of our proposed algorithms, we have conducted proof-of-principle experiments utilizing IBM quantum simulators, of which the results provide a substantial validation of our approach to the extent possible to date.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale measurement study to characterize USCs and their security implications in the wild.

Both deterministic quantities are characterized by differential-integral equations(i.e.,differential equations with non local terms) but with different exterior conditions. The non-Gaussianity of noises manifests as nonlocality at the level of mean exit time and escape probability. An objective of this paper is to make mean exit time and escape probability as efficient computational tools, to the applied probability community, for quantifying stochastic dynamics. An accurate numerical scheme is developed and validated for computing the mean exit time and escape probability. Asymptotic solution for the mean exit time is given when the pure jump measure in the Levy motion is small.   From both the analytical and numerical results, it is observed that the mean exit time depends strongly on the domain size and the value of alpha in the alpha-stable Levy jump measure. The mean exit time can measure which of the two competing factors in alpha-stable Levy motion, i.e. the jump frequency or the jump size, is dominant in helping a process exit a bounded domain. The escape probability is shown to vary with the underlying vector field(i.e.,drift). The mean exit time and escape probability could become discontinuous at the boundary of the domain, when the process is subject to certain deterministic potential and the value of alpha is in (0,1).

0000-0001-9202-5499,Xiaofan Li,"Peking University, Peking University Cancer Hospital",USL-Net: Uncertainty Self-Learning Network for Unsupervised Skin Lesion   Segmentation,1970,"  Unsupervised skin lesion segmentation offers several benefits, including conserving expert human resources, reducing discrepancies due to subjective human labeling, and adapting to novel environments. However, segmenting dermoscopic images without manual labeling guidance presents significant challenges due to dermoscopic image artifacts such as hair noise, blister noise, and subtle edge differences. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Uncertainty Self-Learning Network (USL-Net) designed for skin lesion segmentation. The USL-Net can effectively segment a range of lesions, eliminating the need for manual labeling guidance. Initially, features are extracted using contrastive learning, followed by the generation of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as saliency maps using these features. The different CAM locations correspond to the importance of the lesion region based on their saliency. High-saliency regions in the map serve as pseudo-labels for lesion regions while low-saliency regions represent the background. However, intermediate regions can be hard to classify, often due to their proximity to lesion edges or interference from hair or blisters. Rather than risk potential pseudo-labeling errors or learning confusion by forcefully classifying these regions, we consider them as uncertainty regions, exempting them from pseudo-labeling and allowing the network to self-learn. Further, we employ connectivity detection and centrality detection to refine foreground pseudo-labels and reduce noise-induced errors. The application of cycle refining enhances performance further. Our method underwent thorough experimental validation on the ISIC-2017, ISIC-2018, and PH2 datasets, demonstrating that its performance is on par with weakly supervised and supervised methods, and exceeds that of other existing unsupervised methods.

0000-0002-6430-8712,Lu Yao,"Peking University, Peking University Cancer Hospital",CrossFormer: A Versatile Vision Transformer Hinging on Cross-scale   Attention,1970,"  Transformers have made great progress in dealing with computer vision tasks. However, existing vision transformers do not yet possess the ability of building the interactions among features of different scales, which is perceptually important to visual inputs. The reasons are two-fold: (1) Input embeddings of each layer are equal-scale, so no cross-scale feature can be extracted; (2) to lower the computational cost, some vision transformers merge adjacent embeddings inside the self-attention module, thus sacrificing small-scale (fine-grained) features of the embeddings and also disabling the cross-scale interactions. To this end, we propose Cross-scale Embedding Layer (CEL) and Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA). On the one hand, CEL blends each embedding with multiple patches of different scales, providing the self-attention module itself with cross-scale features. On the other hand, LSDA splits the self-attention module into a short-distance one and a long-distance counterpart, which not only reduces the computational burden but also keeps both small-scale and large-scale features in the embeddings. Through the above two designs, we achieve cross-scale attention. Besides, we put forward a dynamic position bias for vision transformers to make the popular relative position bias apply to variable-sized images. Hinging on the cross-scale attention module, we construct a versatile vision architecture, dubbed CrossFormer, which accommodates variable-sized inputs. Extensive experiments show that CrossFormer outperforms the other vision transformers on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks.

The ability to efficiently create and erase magnetic skyrmions is vital yet challenging for such applications. Based on first-principles studies, we find that switching between intrinsic magnetic skyrmion and high-temperature ferromagnetic states can be achieved in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) multiferroic heterostructure CrSeI/In2Te3 by reversing the ferroelectric polarization of In2Te3. The core mechanism of this switching is traced to the controllable magnetic anisotropy of CrSeI influenced by the ferroelectric polarization of In2Te3. We propose a useful descriptor linking the presence of magnetic skyrmions to magnetic parameters, and validate this connection through studies of a variety of similar vdW multiferroic heterostructures. Our work demonstrates that manipulating magnetic skyrmions via tunable magnetic anisotropies in vdW multiferroic heterostructures represents a highly promising and energy-efficient strategy for future development of spintronics.

0000-0002-5733-7400,Feng Xue,"Peking University, Peking University People's Hospital",Practical Privacy Attacks on Vertical Federated Learning,1970,"  Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving learning paradigm that allows multiple parities to jointly train a powerful machine learning model without sharing their private data. According to the form of collaboration, FL can be further divided into horizontal federated learning (HFL) and vertical federated learning (VFL). In HFL, participants share the same feature space and collaborate on data samples, while in VFL, participants share the same sample IDs and collaborate on features. VFL has a broader scope of applications and is arguably more suitable for joint model training between large enterprises.   In this paper, we focus on VFL and investigate potential privacy leakage in real-world VFL frameworks. We design and implement two practical privacy attacks: reverse multiplication attack for the logistic regression VFL protocol; and reverse sum attack for the XGBoost VFL protocol. We empirically show that the two attacks are (1) effective - the adversary can successfully steal the private training data, even when the intermediate outputs are encrypted to protect data privacy; (2) evasive - the attacks do not deviate from the protocol specification nor deteriorate the accuracy of the target model; and (3) easy - the adversary needs little prior knowledge about the data distribution of the target participant. We also show the leaked information is as effective as the raw training data in training an alternative classifier. We further discuss potential countermeasures and their challenges, which we hope can lead to several promising research directions.

The exponential growth of data traffic in 5G can be supported by having more spectrum and higher spectral efficiency. FD communication promises to double the spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous uplink and downlink transmissions in the same frequency band. Yet for cellular access network with FD base stations (BS) serving multiple users (UE), additional BS-to-BS and UE-to-UE interferences due to FD operation could diminish the performance gain if not tackled properly. In this article, we address the practical system design aspects to exploit FD gain at network scale. We propose efficient reference signal design, low-overhead channel state information feedback and signalling mechanisms to enable FD operation, and develop low-complexity power control and scheduling algorithms to effectively mitigate new interference introduced by FD operation. We extensively evaluate FD network-wide performance in various deployment scenarios and traffic environment with detailed LTE PHY/MAC modelling.

In these systems, parity-time (PT) symmetric states facilitate efficient power transfer. Traditionally, passive resonators have been used as relay devices in such systems to extend transmission distance; however, this approach may induce additional eigenstates with broken PT symmetry, particularly when specific spatial arrangements of the relay resonators, dependent on the positions of the transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) resonators, are not maintained. This limitation hampers applications like free positioning WPT. To address this challenge, we introduce a multibody WPT system employing metamaterial controlled PT symmetry, which circumvents the constraints of physical arrangement. We utilize inverse design to configure the metamaterial, targeting a specific resonance mode that controls the effective coupling coefficients. Our approach ensures that a PT-symmetric state emerges when these coefficients, relating to the metamaterial and both the Tx and Rx resonators, are balanced. We confirm the stability of this state in a strong coupling regime, both theoretically and experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate the formation of PT-symmetric states governed by the metamaterial's resonant mode, achievable even with varying sizes and positions of the Tx and Rx in relation to the metamaterial. Moreover, we show that the PT symmetric state is attainable with different spatial configurations of the Rx resonator. This finding underscores our system's potential for free-positioning WPT, significantly broadening its applicability.

We employ contrastive learning, considering term and explanation embeddings simultaneously, and progressively introduce hard negative samples. Additionally, a ChatGPT-assisted BIRCH algorithm is designed for efficient clustering of a new ontology. Results: We established a clustering test set and a hard negative test set, where our model consistently achieves the highest F1 score. With CoRTEx embeddings and the modified BIRCH algorithm, we grouped 35,580,932 terms from the Biomedical Informatics Ontology System (BIOS) into 22,104,559 clusters with O(N) queries to ChatGPT. Case studies highlight the model's efficacy in handling challenging samples, aided by information from explanations. Conclusion: By aligning terms to their explanations, CoRTEx demonstrates superior accuracy over benchmark models and robustness beyond its training set, and it is suitable for clustering terms for large-scale biomedical ontologies.

Existing forecasting model frameworks struggle with the multifaceted nature of relevant data and robust results translation, which hinders their performances and the provision of actionable insights for public health decision-makers. Our work introduces PandemicLLM, a novel framework with multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information that previously unattainable in traditional forecasting models. This approach, through a unique AI-human cooperative prompt design and time series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs. The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial, and epidemiological time series data, and is subsequently tested across all 50 states of the U.S. Empirically, PandemicLLM is shown to be a high-performing pandemic forecasting framework that effectively captures the impact of emerging variants and can provide timely and accurate predictions. The proposed PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and exhibits performance benefits over existing models. This study illuminates the potential of adapting LLMs and representation learning to enhance pandemic forecasting, illustrating how AI innovations can strengthen pandemic responses and crisis management in the future.

With theoretical guidance using a belief-based learning model, we conduct a multi-period, binary-choice, and weakest-link laboratory coordination experiment to study the effect of gradualism - increasing the required levels (stakes) of contributions slowly over time rather than requiring a high level of contribution immediately - on group coordination performance. We randomly assign subjects to three treatments: starting and continuing at a high stake, starting at a low stake but jumping to a high stake after a few periods, and starting at a low stake while gradually increasing the stakes over time (the Gradualism treatment). We find that relative to the other two treatments, groups coordinate most successfully at high stakes in the Gradualism treatment. We also find evidence that supports the belief-based learning model. These findings point to a simple mechanism for promoting successful voluntary coordination.

We performed the comprehensive benchmark calculations to evaluate the performance of the MM-SQC method in various site-exciton models with respect to the accurate results of quantum dynamics method multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH). The parameters of the site-exciton models are chosen to represent a few of prototypes used in the description of photoinduced excitonic dynamics processes in photoharvesting systems and organic solar cells, which include the rather board situations with the fast or slow bath and different system-bath couplings. When the characteristic frequency of the bath is low, the MM-SQC method performs extremely well, and it gives almost the identical results to those of ML-MCTDH. When the fast bath is considered, the deviations exist between the MM-SQC and ML-MCTDH results if the high-frequency bath modes are improperly treated by the classical manner. When the so-called adiabatic renormalization was employed to construct the reduced Hamiltonian by freezing high-frequency modes, the MM-SQC dynamics can give the results comparable to the ML-MCTDH ones. Thus, the MM-SQC method itself provide reasonable results in all test site-exciton models, while the proper treatments of the bath modes must be employed. The possible dependence of the MM-SQC dynamics on the different initial sampling methods for the nuclear degrees of freedom is also discussed.

Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration. We evaluate the framework's efficacy through a case study and expert interviews. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0D01ECA0>,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0003-1817-6357,Jie Zheng,Peking University,Probing the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the   energy scale of reheating with pulsar timing arrays,1970,"  The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) provides a unique opportunity to probe the early Universe, potentially encoding information about the primordial curvature power spectrum and the energy scale of reheating. Recent observations by collaborations such as NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, and CPTA have detected a stochastic common-spectrum signal, which may originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by primordial curvature perturbations during inflation. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the NANOGrav signal is sourced by SIGWs and aim to constrain the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the reheating energy scale using the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We model the primordial curvature power spectrum with a lognormal form and focus on the case where the equation of state during reheating is $w=1/6$, corresponding to an inflaton potential $V(\phi) \sim \phi^{14/5}$. Employing Bayesian inference, we obtain posterior distributions for the lognormal power spectrum parameters and the reheating temperature. Our results indicate a narrow peak in the primordial power spectrum ($\Delta < 0.001$ at 90\% confidence) and a lower bound on the reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh} \geq 0.1 {\rm GeV}$), consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints. The best-fit SIGW energy density spectrum exhibits a distinct turning point around $f \sim 10^{-8.1}\,{\rm Hz}$, corresponding to the transition from reheating to the radiation-dominated era. This feature, combined with the sharp high-frequency decrease due to the narrow primordial power spectrum peak, offers a unique signature for probing early Universe properties.

0000-0003-1817-6357,Jie Zheng,Peking University,Initial Sampling in Symmetrical Quasiclassical Dynamics Based on   Li-Miller Mapping Hamiltonian,1970,"  A symmetrical quasiclassical (SQC) dynamics approach based on the Li-Miller (LM) mapping Hamiltonian (SQC-LM) was employed to describe nonadiabatic dynamics. In principle, the different initial sampling procedures may be applied in the SQC-LM dynamics, and the results may be dependent on the initial sampling. We provided various initial sampling approaches and checked their influence. We selected two groups of models including site-exciton models for exciton dynamics and linear vibronic coupling models for conical intersections to test the performance of SQC-LM dynamics with the different initial sampling methods. The results were examined with respect to those of the accurate multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) quantum dynamics. For both two models, the SQC-LM method more-or-less gives a reasonable description of the population dynamics, while the influence of the initial sampling approaches on the final results is noticeable. It seems that the proper initial sampling methods should be determined by the system under study. This indicates that the combination of the SQC-LM method with a suitable sampling approach may be a potential method in the description of nonadiabatic dynamics.

However, with the fast-paced growth of biomedical literature, there is a growing need for automated and accurate extraction of PPIs to facilitate scientific knowledge discovery. Pre-trained language models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have shown promising results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluated the performance of PPI identification of multiple GPT and BERT models using three manually curated gold-standard corpora: Learning Language in Logic (LLL) with 164 PPIs in 77 sentences, Human Protein Reference Database with 163 PPIs in 145 sentences, and Interaction Extraction Performance Assessment with 335 PPIs in 486 sentences. BERT-based models achieved the best overall performance, with BioBERT achieving the highest recall (91.95%) and F1-score (86.84%) and PubMedBERT achieving the highest precision (85.25%). Interestingly, despite not being explicitly trained for biomedical texts, GPT-4 achieved commendable performance, comparable to the top-performing BERT models. It achieved a precision of 88.37%, a recall of 85.14%, and an F1-score of 86.49% on the LLL dataset. These results suggest that GPT models can effectively detect PPIs from text data, offering promising avenues for application in biomedical literature mining. Further research could explore how these models might be fine-tuned for even more specialized tasks within the biomedical domain.

0000-0003-1817-6357,Jie Zheng,Peking University,PASTO: Strategic Parameter Optimization in Recommendation Systems --   Probabilistic is Better than Deterministic,1970,"  Real-world recommendation systems often consist of two phases. In the first phase, multiple predictive models produce the probability of different immediate user actions. In the second phase, these predictions are aggregated according to a set of 'strategic parameters' to meet a diverse set of business goals, such as longer user engagement, higher revenue potential, or more community/network interactions. In addition to building accurate predictive models, it is also crucial to optimize this set of 'strategic parameters' so that primary goals are optimized while secondary guardrails are not hurt. In this setting with multiple and constrained goals, this paper discovers that a probabilistic strategic parameter regime can achieve better value compared to the standard regime of finding a single deterministic parameter. The new probabilistic regime is to learn the best distribution over strategic parameter choices and sample one strategic parameter from the distribution when each user visits the platform. To pursue the optimal probabilistic solution, we formulate the problem into a stochastic compositional optimization problem, in which the unbiased stochastic gradient is unavailable. Our approach is applied in a popular social network platform with hundreds of millions of daily users and achieves +0.22% lift of user engagement in a recommendation task and +1.7% lift in revenue in an advertising optimization scenario comparing to using the best deterministic parameter strategy.

The fundamental mechanism is rooted in the intrinsically nonequilibrium steady state. In the current investigation, we experimentally verify this concept, with the weak gravitational force being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on capacitive cells with the same nanoporous electrodes and various electrolyte concentrations. The key characteristic is that the nanopore size is only slightly larger than the ion size, less than twice the ion size. The confinement effect of the nanopore walls plays the role of the spontaneously nonequilibrium dimension (SND). At first glance, the capacitive cells exhibit ""normal"" charge curves. However, their steady-state ion distribution significantly differs from thermodynamic equilibrium. The measured potential difference is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the prediction of equilibrium thermodynamics. Such phenomena are in line with the molecular dynamics simulations reported in the open literature.

0000-0002-6448-1267,Meng Wang,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Cross-Entropy Adversarial View Adaptation for Person Re-identification,1970,"  Person re-identification (re-ID) is a task of matching pedestrians under disjoint camera views. To recognise paired snapshots, it has to cope with large cross-view variations caused by the camera view shift. Supervised deep neural networks are effective in producing a set of non-linear projections that can transform cross-view images into a common feature space. However, they typically impose a symmetric architecture, yielding the network ill-conditioned on its optimisation. In this paper, we learn view-invariant subspace for person re-ID, and its corresponding similarity metric using an adversarial view adaptation approach. The main contribution is to learn coupled asymmetric mappings regarding view characteristics which are adversarially trained to address the view discrepancy by optimising the cross-entropy view confusion objective. To determine the similarity value, the network is empowered with a similarity discriminator to promote features that are highly discriminant in distinguishing positive and negative pairs. The other contribution includes an adaptive weighing on the most difficult samples to address the imbalance of within/between-identity pairs.

Ensuring IP safety for trainers and owners is of utmost importance, particularly in domains where ownership verification and applicability authorization are required. A notable approach to safeguarding model IP involves proactively preventing the use of well-trained models of authorized domains from unauthorized domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel Compact Un-transferable Pyramid Isolation Domain (CUPI-Domain) which serves as a barrier against illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. Drawing inspiration from human transitive inference and learning abilities, the CUPI-Domain is designed to obstruct cross-domain transfers by emphasizing the distinctive style features of the authorized domain. This emphasis leads to failure in recognizing irrelevant private style features on unauthorized domains. To this end, we propose novel CUPI-Domain generators, which select features from both authorized and CUPI-Domain as anchors. Then, we fuse the style features and semantic features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich CUPI-Domain. Additionally, we design external Domain-Information Memory Banks (DIMB) for storing and updating labeled pyramid features to obtain stable domain class features and domain class-wise style features. Based on the proposed whole method, the novel style and discriminative loss functions are designed to effectively enhance the distinction in style and discriminative features between authorized and unauthorized domains, respectively. Moreover, we provide two solutions for utilizing CUPI-Domain based on whether the unauthorized domain is known: target-specified CUPI-Domain and target-free CUPI-Domain.

However, to realize their full potential, we must mitigate qubit errors (from noise) by developing noise-aware algorithms, compilers, and architectures. Thus, simulating quantum programs on classical computers with different noise models is a de-facto tool that is used by researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately, noisy quantum simulators iteratively execute the same circuit across multiple trials (shots), thereby incurring high-performance overheads. To address this, we propose a noisy simulation technique called Tree-Based Quantum Circuit Simulation (TQSim). TQSim exploits the reusability of the intermediate results during the noisy simulation and reduces computation. TQSim dynamically partitions a circuit into several subcircuits. It then reuses the intermediate results from these subcircuits during computation. As compared to a noisy Qulacs-based baseline simulator, TQSim achieves an average speedup of 2.51x across 48 different benchmark circuits. Additionally, across benchmarks, TQSim produces results with a normalized fidelity that is within the 0.016 range of the baseline normalized fidelity.

To accurately detect potential vehicle collisions, reachability-based formal approaches have been developed to ensure driving safety, but suffer from over-conservatism, potentially leading to false-positive risk events in complicated real-world applications. In this work, we combine two reachability analysis techniques, i.e., backward reachable set (BRS) and stochastic forward reachable set (FRS), and propose an integrated probabilistic collision detection framework in highway driving. Within the framework, we can firstly use a BRS to formally check whether a two-vehicle interaction is safe; otherwise, a prediction-based stochastic FRS is employed to estimate a collision probability at each future time step. In doing so, the framework can not only identify non-risky events with guaranteed safety, but also provide accurate collision risk estimation in safety-critical events. To construct the stochastic FRS, we develop a neural network-based acceleration model for surrounding vehicles, and further incorporate confidence-aware dynamic belief to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the acceleration prediction model based on naturalistic highway driving data, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework with the infused confidence belief are tested both in naturalistic and simulated highway scenarios.

0000-0002-6448-1267,Meng Wang,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Contrastive Positive Sample Propagation along the Audio-Visual Event   Line,1970,"  Visual and audio signals often coexist in natural environments, forming audio-visual events (AVEs). Given a video, we aim to localize video segments containing an AVE and identify its category. It is pivotal to learn the discriminative features for each video segment. Unlike existing work focusing on audio-visual feature fusion, in this paper, we propose a new contrastive positive sample propagation (CPSP) method for better deep feature representation learning. The contribution of CPSP is to introduce the available full or weak label as a prior that constructs the exact positive-negative samples for contrastive learning. Specifically, the CPSP involves comprehensive contrastive constraints: pair-level positive sample propagation (PSP), segment-level and video-level positive sample activation (PSA$_S$ and PSA$_V$). Three new contrastive objectives are proposed (\emph{i.e.}, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{avpsp}}$, $\mathcal{L}_\text{spsa}$, and $\mathcal{L}_\text{vpsa}$) and introduced into both the fully and weakly supervised AVE localization. To draw a complete picture of the contrastive learning in AVE localization, we also study the self-supervised positive sample propagation (SSPSP). As a result, CPSP is more helpful to obtain the refined audio-visual features that are distinguishable from the negatives, thus benefiting the classifier prediction. Extensive experiments on the AVE and the newly collected VGGSound-AVEL100k datasets verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

However, our understanding of its dynamics is limited, and models for perceived risk dynamics are scarce in the literature. This study formulates a new computational perceived risk model based on potential collision avoidance difficulty (PCAD) for drivers of SAE level 2 driving automation. PCAD uses the 2D safe velocity gap as the potential collision avoidance difficulty, and takes into account collision severity. The safe velocity gap is defined as the 2D gap between the current velocity and the safe velocity region, and represents the amount of braking and steering needed, considering behavioural uncertainty of neighbouring vehicles and imprecise control of the subject vehicle. The PCAD predicts perceived risk both in continuous time and per event. We compare the PCAD model with three state-of-the-art models and analyse the models both theoretically and empirically with two unique datasets: Dataset Merging and Dataset Obstacle Avoidance. The PCAD model generally outperforms the other models in terms of model error, detection rate, and the ability to accurately capture the tendencies of human drivers' perceived risk, albeit at a longer computation time. Additionally, the study shows that the perceived risk is not static and varies with the surrounding traffic conditions.

For congruent driving behaviors, it is essential to recognize and comprehend sociality, encompassing both implicit social norms and individualized social preferences of human drivers. To understand and quantify the complex sociality in driving interactions, we propose a Virtual-Game-based Interaction Model (VGIM) that is parameterized by a social preference measurement, Interaction Preference Value (IPV). The IPV is designed to capture the driver's relative inclination towards individual rewards over group rewards. A method for identifying IPV from observed driving trajectory is also developed, with which we assessed human drivers' IPV using driving data recorded in a typical interactive driving scenario, the unprotected left turn. Our findings reveal that (1) human drivers exhibit particular social preference patterns while undertaking specific tasks, such as turning left or proceeding straight; (2) competitive actions could be strategically conducted by human drivers in order to coordinate with others. Finally, we discuss the potential of learning sociality-aware navigation from human demonstrations by incorporating a rule-based humanlike IPV expressing strategy into VGIM and optimization-based motion planners. Simulation experiments demonstrate that (1) IPV identification improves the motion prediction performance in interactive driving scenarios and (2) the dynamic IPV expressing strategy extracted from human driving data makes it possible to reproduce humanlike coordination patterns in the driving interaction.

This paper presents an innovative approach to medical image classification, leveraging Federated Learning (FL) to address the dual challenges of data privacy and efficient disease diagnosis. Traditional Centralized Machine Learning models, despite their widespread use in medical imaging for tasks such as disease diagnosis, raise significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of patient data.

Prior methods directly model the motion field from the Eulerian perspective by Representation Learning that separates shape and texture or Multi-domain Learning from phase fluctuations. Inspired by the frequency spectrum, we observe that the low-frequency components with stable energy always possess spatial structure and less noise, making them suitable for modeling the subtle motion field. To this end, we present FD4MM, a new paradigm of Frequency Decoupling for Motion Magnification with a Multi-level Isomorphic Architecture to capture multi-level high-frequency details and a stable low-frequency structure (motion field) in video space. Since high-frequency details and subtle motions are susceptible to information degradation due to their inherent subtlety and unavoidable external interference from noise, we carefully design Sparse High/Low-pass Filters to enhance the integrity of details and motion structures, and a Sparse Frequency Mixer to promote seamless recoupling. Besides, we innovatively design a contrastive regularization for this task to strengthen the model's ability to discriminate irrelevant features, reducing undesired motion magnification.

The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of ""retrieve-then-generate"". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.

By modelling the transform coefficients with the composite Cauchy distribution, higher accuracy compared with traditional distributions has been achieved. Based on the transform coefficient modelling, the theoretically derived R-Q and D-Q models which have been shown to deliver higher accuracy in characterizing RD characteristics for sequences with different content are incorporated into the rate control process. Furthermore, to establish an adaptive bit allocation scheme, the dependency between different levels of frames is modelled by a dependency factor to describe relationship between the reference and to-be-coded frames. Given the derived R-Q and D-Q relationships, as well as the dependency factor, an adaptive bit allocation scheme is developed for optimal bits allocation. We implement the proposed algorithm on VVC Test Model (VTM) 3.0. Experiments show that due to proper bit allocation, for low delay configuration the proposed algorithm can achieve 1.03% BD-Rate saving compared with the default rate control algorithm and 2.96% BD-Rate saving compared with fixed QP scheme. Moreover, 1.29% BD-Rate saving and higher control accuracy have also been observed under the random access configuration.

However, most sophisticated machine learning approaches suffer from huge time costs when operating on large-scale data. This issue calls for the need of {Large-scale Machine Learning} (LML), which aims to learn patterns from big data with comparable performance efficiently. In this paper, we offer a systematic survey on existing LML methods to provide a blueprint for the future developments of this area. We first divide these LML methods according to the ways of improving the scalability: 1) model simplification on computational complexities, 2) optimization approximation on computational efficiency, and 3) computation parallelism on computational capabilities. Then we categorize the methods in each perspective according to their targeted scenarios and introduce representative methods in line with intrinsic strategies. Lastly, we analyze their limitations and discuss potential directions as well as open issues that are promising to address in the future.

First, a network architecture is designed to extract and fuse features from multiple modalities, i.e. photograph from visual modality and geographic locality information from language modality. Then, logit adjustment based methods are studied to relieve the impact caused by the severe class imbalance. Next, a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning method is proposed to make full use of the dataset, including both labeled training data and unlabeled testing data. Finally, post processing strategies, such as multi-scale and multi-crop test-time-augmentation, location filtering and model ensemble, are employed for better performance.

Given a video, we aim to localize video segments containing an AVE and identify its category. In order to learn discriminative features for a classifier, it is pivotal to identify the helpful (or positive) audio-visual segment pairs while filtering out the irrelevant ones, regardless whether they are synchronized or not. To this end, we propose a new positive sample propagation (PSP) module to discover and exploit the closely related audio-visual pairs by evaluating the relationship within every possible pair. It can be done by constructing an all-pair similarity map between each audio and visual segment, and only aggregating the features from the pairs with high similarity scores. To encourage the network to extract high correlated features for positive samples, a new audio-visual pair similarity loss is proposed. We also propose a new weighting branch to better exploit the temporal correlations in weakly supervised setting. We perform extensive experiments on the public AVE dataset and achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy in both fully and weakly supervised settings, thus verifying the effectiveness of our method.

However, nodes may belong to several communities in the network, and detecting all the communities for the query node set, termed as the multiple local community detection (MLCD), is more important as it could uncover more potential information. MLCD is also more challenging because when a query node belongs to multiple communities, it always locates in the complicated overlapping region and the marginal region of communities. Accordingly, detecting multiple communities for such nodes by applying seed expansion methods is insufficient.   In this work, we address the MLCD based on higher-order structural importance (HoSI). First, to effectively estimate the influence of higher-order structures, we propose a new variant of random walk called Active Random Walk to measure the HoSI score between nodes. Then, we propose two new metrics to evaluate the HoSI score of a subgraph to a node and the HoSI score of a node, respectively. Based on the proposed metrics, we present a novel algorithm called HoSIM to detect multiple local communities for a single query node. HoSIM enforces a three-stage processing, namely subgraph sampling, core member identification, and local community detection. The key idea is utilizing HoSI to find and identify the core members of communities relevant to the query node and optimize the generated communities. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of HoSIM. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0EC0D0D0>,Yes,potent(1)

However, results from LLMs can be highly unstable; nondeterministically returning very different codes for the same prompt. Non-determinism is a potential menace to scientific conclusion validity. When non-determinism is high, scientific conclusions simply cannot be relied upon unless researchers change their behaviour to control for it in their empirical analyses. This paper conducts an empirical study to demonstrate that non-determinism is, indeed, high, thereby underlining the need for this behavioural change. We choose to study ChatGPT because it is already highly prevalent in the code generation research literature. We report results from a study of 829 code generation problems from three code generation benchmarks (i.e., CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval). Our results reveal high degrees of non-determinism: the ratio of coding tasks with zero equal test output across different requests is 72.73%, 60.40%, and 65.85% for CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval, respectively. In addition, we find that setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation, although it indeed brings less non-determinism than the default configuration (temperature=1). These results confirm that there is, currently, a significant threat to scientific conclusion validity. In order to put LLM-based research on firmer scientific foundations, researchers need to take into account non-determinism in drawing their conclusions.

0000-0002-6448-1267,Meng Wang,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Dual-path TokenLearner for Remote Photoplethysmography-based   Physiological Measurement with Facial Videos,1970,"  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based physiological measurement is an emerging yet crucial vision task, whose challenge lies in exploring accurate rPPG prediction from facial videos accompanied by noises of illumination variations, facial occlusions, head movements, \etc, in a non-contact manner. Existing mainstream CNN-based models make efforts to detect physiological signals by capturing subtle color changes in facial regions of interest (ROI) caused by heartbeats. However, such models are constrained by the limited local spatial or temporal receptive fields in the neural units. Unlike them, a native Transformer-based framework called Dual-path TokenLearner (Dual-TL) is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the concept of learnable tokens to integrate both spatial and temporal informative contexts from the global perspective of the video. Specifically, the proposed Dual-TL uses a Spatial TokenLearner (S-TL) to explore associations in different facial ROIs, which promises the rPPG prediction far away from noisy ROI disturbances. Complementarily, a Temporal TokenLearner (T-TL) is designed to infer the quasi-periodic pattern of heartbeats, which eliminates temporal disturbances such as head movements. The two TokenLearners, S-TL and T-TL, are executed in a dual-path mode. This enables the model to reduce noise disturbances for final rPPG signal prediction. Extensive experiments on four physiological measurement benchmark datasets are conducted. The Dual-TL achieves state-of-the-art performances in both intra- and cross-dataset testings, demonstrating its immense potential as a basic backbone for rPPG measurement.

0000-0002-6448-1267,Meng Wang,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Exploring Sparse Spatial Relation in Graph Inference for Text-Based VQA,1970,"  Text-based visual question answering (TextVQA) faces the significant challenge of avoiding redundant relational inference. To be specific, a large number of detected objects and optical character recognition (OCR) tokens result in rich visual relationships. Existing works take all visual relationships into account for answer prediction. However, there are three observations: (1) a single subject in the images can be easily detected as multiple objects with distinct bounding boxes (considered repetitive objects). The associations between these repetitive objects are superfluous for answer reasoning; (2) two spatially distant OCR tokens detected in the image frequently have weak semantic dependencies for answer reasoning; and (3) the co-existence of nearby objects and tokens may be indicative of important visual cues for predicting answers. Rather than utilizing all of them for answer prediction, we make an effort to identify the most important connections or eliminate redundant ones. We propose a sparse spatial graph network (SSGN) that introduces a spatially aware relation pruning technique to this task. As spatial factors for relation measurement, we employ spatial distance, geometric dimension, overlap area, and DIoU for spatially aware pruning. We consider three visual relationships for graph learning: object-object, OCR-OCR tokens, and object-OCR token relationships. SSGN is a progressive graph learning architecture that verifies the pivotal relations in the correlated object-token sparse graph, and then in the respective object-based sparse graph and token-based sparse graph. Experiment results on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets demonstrate that SSGN achieves promising performances. And some visualization results further demonstrate the interpretability of our method.

The proposed framework consists of a two-layer design: the upper level control sequences the vehicles to harmonize the traffic density across mainline and on-ramp segments while enhancing lower-level control efficiency through a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Subsequently, the lower-level control employs a longitudinal distributed model predictive control (MPC) supplemented by a virtual car-following (CF) concept to ensure asymptotic local stability, l_2 norm string stability, and safety. Proofs of asymptotic local stability and l_2 norm string stability are mathematically derived. Compared to other prevalent asymptotic local-stable MPC controllers, the proposed distributed MPC controller greatly expands the initial feasible set. Additionally, an auxiliary lateral control is developed to maintain lane-keeping and merging smoothness while accommodating ramp geometric curvature. To validate the proposed framework, multiple numerical experiments are conducted. Results indicate a notable outperformance of our upper-level controller against a distance-based sequencing method. Furthermore, the lower-level control effectively ensures smooth acceleration, safe merging with adequate spacing, adherence to proven longitudinal local and string stability, and rapid regulation of lateral deviations.

It offers insights into the feelings and intentions of individuals and is important for human-oriented applications such as emotion recognition and psychological assessment. However, the identification, differentiation, and understanding of micro-actions pose challenges due to the imperceptible and inaccessible nature of these subtle human behaviors in everyday life. In this study, we innovatively collect a new micro-action dataset designated as Micro-action-52 (MA-52), and propose a benchmark named micro-action network (MANet) for micro-action recognition (MAR) task. Uniquely, MA-52 provides the whole-body perspective including gestures, upper- and lower-limb movements, attempting to reveal comprehensive micro-action cues. In detail, MA-52 contains 52 micro-action categories along with seven body part labels, and encompasses a full array of realistic and natural micro-actions, accounting for 205 participants and 22,422 video instances collated from the psychological interviews. Based on the proposed dataset, we assess MANet and other nine prevalent action recognition methods. MANet incorporates squeeze-and excitation (SE) and temporal shift module (TSM) into the ResNet architecture for modeling the spatiotemporal characteristics of micro-actions. Then a joint-embedding loss is designed for semantic matching between video and action labels; the loss is used to better distinguish between visually similar yet distinct micro-action categories.

0000-0002-6448-1267,Meng Wang,"Peking University, Peking University Third Hospital",Reinforced Negative Sampling over Knowledge Graph for Recommendation,1970,"  Properly handling missing data is a fundamental challenge in recommendation. Most present works perform negative sampling from unobserved data to supply the training of recommender models with negative signals. Nevertheless, existing negative sampling strategies, either static or adaptive ones, are insufficient to yield high-quality negative samples --- both informative to model training and reflective of user real needs. In this work, we hypothesize that item knowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG entities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples. Towards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph Policy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to explore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed exploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction, adaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a potential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix factorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant improvements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS and IRGAN, and KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT. Further analyses from different angles provide insights of knowledge-aware sampling. We release the codes and datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/kgpolicy.

In this paper, we study cooperative data collection using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the objective of minimizing the total average Age of Information (AoI). We consider various constraints of the UAVs, including kinematic, energy, trajectory, and collision avoidance, in order to optimize the data collection process. Specifically, each UAV, which has limited on-board energy, takes off from its initial location and flies over sensor nodes to collect update packets in cooperation with the other UAVs. The UAVs must land at their final destinations with non-negative residual energy after the specified time duration to ensure they have enough energy to complete their missions. It is crucial to design the trajectories of the UAVs and the transmission scheduling of the sensor nodes to enhance information freshness. We model the multi-UAV data collection problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), as each UAV is unaware of the dynamics of the environment and can only observe a part of the sensors. To address the challenges of this problem, we propose a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm with centralized learning and decentralized execution. In addition to the reward shaping, we use action masks to filter out invalid actions and ensure that the constraints are met. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total average AoI compared to the baseline algorithms, and the use of the action mask method can improve the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm.

The compression of such data becomes challenging with overwhelming data amounts comprising millions of points. Herein, we leverage the human geometric prior in geometry redundancy removal of point clouds, greatly promoting the compression performance. More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as geometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter set that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and structural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point cloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact latent code. The proposed framework can operate in a play-and-plug fashion with existing learning based point cloud compression methods.

With little workload to manually annotate these active samples, the distortion of the target-domain distribution can be effectively alleviated, resulting in a large performance gain. The multi-anchor strategy is additionally employed to model the target-distribution. By regularizing the latent representation of the target samples compact around multiple anchors through a novel soft alignment loss, more precise segmentation can be achieved. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, along with thorough ablation study to verify the effectiveness of each component.

0000-0003-2445-5387,Shuang Yu,"Peking University, peking university",Toward the Automated Construction of Probabilistic Knowledge Graphs for   the Maritime Domain,1970,"  International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results.

The car consists of an Arduino board, an H-bridge, and motors. The objective of the project is to create a system that can move a car in different directions using a computer application. The system uses Unity software to create a virtual environment where the user can control the car using keyboard commands. The car's motion is achieved by sending signals from the computer to the Arduino board, which then drives the motors through the H-bridge. The project provides a cost-effective and efficient way to build a car, which can be used for educational purposes, such as teaching programming. Moreover, this project is not limited to the control of the car through keyboard commands in a virtual environment. The system can be adapted to support augmented reality (AR) technology, providing an even more immersive and engaging user experience. By integrating the car with AR, the user can control the car's motion using physical gestures and movements, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the system. This makes the car an ideal platform for game development in AR, allowing the user to create driving games that blend the physical and virtual worlds seamlessly. Additionally, the car's affordability and ease of construction make it an accessible and valuable tool for teaching programming and principles in a fun and interactive way. Overall, this project demonstrates the versatility and potential of the car system, highlighting the various applications and possibilities it offers for both education and entertainment.

Graph is a common data structure in the real world, and understanding graph data is a crucial part for advancing general intelligence. To evaluate and enhance the graph understanding abilities of LLMs, in this paper, we propose a benchmark named GraphInstruct, which comprehensively includes 21 classical graph reasoning tasks, providing diverse graph generation pipelines and detailed reasoning steps. Based on GraphInstruct, we further construct GraphLM through efficient instruction-tuning, which shows prominent graph understanding capability. In order to enhance the LLM with graph reasoning capability as well, we propose a step mask training strategy, and construct a model named GraphLM+. As one of the pioneering efforts to enhance the graph understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs, extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GraphLM and GraphLM+ over other LLMs. We look forward to more researchers exploring the potential of LLMs in the graph data mining domain through GraphInstruct.

Causal discovery offers a promising approach to improve transparency and reliability. However, current evaluations are often one-sided and lack assessments focused on interpretability performance. Additionally, these evaluations rely on synthetic data and lack comprehensive assessments of real-world datasets. These lead to promising methods potentially being overlooked. To address these issues, we propose a flexible evaluation framework with metrics for evaluating differences in causal structures and causal effects, which are crucial attributes that help improve the interpretability of LLMs. We introduce the Open Causal Discovery Benchmark (OCDB), based on real data, to promote fair comparisons and drive optimization of algorithms. Additionally, our new metrics account for undirected edges, enabling fair comparisons between Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graphs (CPDAGs). Experimental results show significant shortcomings in existing algorithms' generalization capabilities on real data, highlighting the potential for performance improvement and the importance of our framework in advancing causal discovery techniques.

The capability to stylize and de-couple objects within these scenarios is a crucial factor, providing an advanced level of control throughout the editing process. This control extends not just to manipulating geometric attributes like translation and scaling but also includes managing appearances, such as stylization. Current methods for scene stylization are limited to applying styles to the entire scene, without the ability to separate and customize individual objects. Addressing the intricacies of this challenge, we introduce a unique pipeline designed for synthesis 3D indoor scenes. Our approach involves strategically placing objects within the scene, utilizing information from professionally designed bounding boxes. Significantly, our pipeline prioritizes maintaining style consistency across multiple objects within the scene, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing result aligned with the desired aesthetic. The core strength of our pipeline lies in its ability to generate 3D scenes that are not only visually impressive but also exhibit features like photorealism, multi-view consistency, and diversity.

0000-0002-1468-1586,Hong Huang,"Peking University, Peking University First Hospital",Show Me the Whole World: Towards Entire Item Space Exploration for   Interactive Personalized Recommendations,1970,"  User interest exploration is an important and challenging topic in recommender systems, which alleviates the closed-loop effects between recommendation models and user-item interactions. Contextual bandit (CB) algorithms strive to make a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation so that users' potential interests have chances to expose. However, classical CB algorithms can only be applied to a small, sampled item set (usually hundreds), which forces the typical applications in recommender systems limited to candidate post-ranking, homepage top item ranking, ad creative selection, or online model selection (A/B test).   In this paper, we introduce two simple but effective hierarchical CB algorithms to make a classical CB model (such as LinUCB and Thompson Sampling) capable to explore users' interest in the entire item space without limiting it to a small item set. We first construct a hierarchy item tree via a bottom-up clustering algorithm to organize items in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then we propose a hierarchical CB (HCB) algorithm to explore users' interest in the hierarchy tree. HCB takes the exploration problem as a series of decision-making processes, where the goal is to find a path from the root to a leaf node, and the feedback will be back-propagated to all the nodes in the path. We further propose a progressive hierarchical CB (pHCB) algorithm, which progressively extends visible nodes which reach a confidence level for exploration, to avoid misleading actions on upper-level nodes in the sequential decision-making process. Extensive experiments on two public recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our methods.

The vehicle can learn the driving policy in a stable and familiar environment, which is efficient and reliable.

0000-0002-3119-654X,Jing Chen,The University of Hong Kong,Cons-training tensor networks,1970,"  In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed \textit{constrained matrix product states} (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.

0000-0002-3119-654X,Jing Chen,The University of Hong Kong,Optimal Provision-After-Wait in Healthcare,1970,"  We investigate computational and mechanism design aspects of scarce resource allocation, where the primary rationing mechanism is through waiting times. Specifically we consider allocating medical treatments to a population of patients. Each patient needs exactly one treatment, and can choose from $k$ hospitals. Hospitals have different costs, which are fully paid by a third party ---the ""payer"". The payer has a fixed budget $B$, and each hospital will have its own waiting time. At equilibrium, each patient will choose his most preferred hospital given his intrinsic preferences and the waiting times. The payer thus computes the waiting times so that at equilibrium the budget constraint is satisfied and the social welfare is maximized.   We first show that the optimization problem is NP-hard, yet if the budget can be relaxed to $(1+\epsilon)B$ for an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, then the optimum under budget $B$ can be approximated efficiently. Next, we study the endogenous emergence of waiting time from the dynamics between hospitals and patients, and show that there is no need for the payer to explicitly enforce the optimal waiting times. Under certain conditions, all he need is to enforce the amount of money he wants to pay to each hospital. The dynamics will always converge to the desired waiting times in finite time.   We then go beyond equilibrium solutions and investigate the optimization problem over a much larger class of mechanisms containing the equilibrium ones as special cases. With two hospitals, we show that under a natural assumption on the patients' preference profiles, optimal welfare is in fact attained by the randomized assignment mechanism, which allocates patients to hospitals at random subject to the budget constraint, but avoids waiting times.   Finally, we discuss potential policy implications of our results, as well as follow-up directions and open problems.

Many interesting features, such as the accumulation of emitted electrons in the first and third quadrants of parallel momentum plane, the regular pattern of correlated momentum with respect to the time delay between closest collision and ionization moment, are revealed and successfully explained by back analyzing the classical trajectories.

Although the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a systematic way to incorporate these uncertainties, it quickly becomes computationally intractable when scaled to the real-world large-size problem. In this paper, we present an efficient uncertainty-aware decision-making (EUDM) framework, which generates long-term lateral and longitudinal behaviors in complex driving environments in real-time. The computation complexity is controlled to an appropriate level by two novel techniques, namely, the domain-specific closed-loop policy tree (DCP-Tree) structure and conditional focused branching (CFB) mechanism. The key idea is utilizing domain-specific expert knowledge to guide the branching in both action and intention space. The proposed framework is validated using both onboard sensing data captured by a real vehicle and an interactive multi-agent simulation platform.

EPSILON is an efficient interaction-aware planning system for automated driving, and is extensively validated in both simulation and real-world dense city traffic. It follows a hierarchical structure with an interactive behavior planning layer and an optimization-based motion planning layer. The behavior planning is formulated from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), but is much more efficient than naively applying a POMDP to the decision-making problem. The key to efficiency is guided branching in both the action space and observation space, which decomposes the original problem into a limited number of closed-loop policy evaluations. Moreover, we introduce a new driver model with a safety mechanism to overcome the risk induced by the potential imperfectness of prior knowledge. For motion planning, we employ a spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) to model the constraints posed by complex driving environments in a unified way. Based on the SSC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized, complying with the decision provided by the behavior planner. We validate our planning system in both simulations and real-world dense traffic, and the experimental results show that our EPSILON achieves human-like driving behaviors in highly interactive traffic flow smoothly and safely without being over-conservative compared to the existing planning methods.

Particularly, due to policy uncertainty and the frequent market fluctuations triggered by sudden economic events, existing models often struggle to accurately predict market dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Stockformer, a price-volume factor stock selection model that integrates wavelet transformation and a multitask self-attention network, aimed at enhancing responsiveness and predictive accuracy regarding market instabilities. Through discrete wavelet transform, Stockformer decomposes stock returns into high and low frequencies, meticulously capturing long-term market trends and short-term fluctuations, including abrupt events. Moreover, the model incorporates a Dual-Frequency Spatiotemporal Encoder and graph embedding techniques to effectively capture complex temporal and spatial relationships among stocks. Employing a multitask learning strategy, it simultaneously predicts stock returns and directional trends. Experimental results show that Stockformer outperforms existing advanced methods on multiple real stock market datasets. In strategy backtesting, Stockformer consistently demonstrates exceptional stability and reliability across market conditions-whether rising, falling, or fluctuating-particularly maintaining high performance during downturns or volatile periods, indicating a high adaptability to market fluctuations. To foster innovation and collaboration in the financial analysis sector, the Stockformer model's code has been open-sourced and is available on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Eric991005/Multitask-Stockformer.

The effect of the parameter $\alpha$ on the gravitational resonances is studied. As a brane splits into multi sub-branes, the effective potential of the tensor perturbation will have an abundant inner structure with multi-wells, and this will lead to new phenomena of the gravitational resonances.

Here a general picture of tunneling time is suggested by introducing a quantum travel time, which is defined as the ratio of the travel distance to the expected value of the velocity operator under the barrier. Specially, if applied to rectangular barrier tunneling, it can retrieve the B\""{u}ttiker-Landauer time $\tau_{BL}$ in the case of an opaque barrier, and has a clear physical meaning in the case of a very thin barrier wherein $\tau_{BL}$ can not be well defined. In the case of strong-field tunneling process, with the help of the newly defined time, the tunneling delay time measured by attoclock experiment can be interpreted as a travel time spent by the electron to tunnel from a point under the barrier to the tunnel exit. In addition, a peculiar oscillation structure in the wavelength dependence of tunneling delay time in deep tunneling regime is observed, which is beyond the scope of adiabatic tunneling picture. This oscillation structure can be attributed to the interference between the ground state tunneling channel and the excited states tunneling channels.

For genetic algorithm-based fuzzing, it can mutate the seed files provided by users to obtain a number of inputs, which are then used to test the objective application in order to trigger potential crashes. As shown in existing literature, the seed file selection is crucial for the efficiency of fuzzing. However, current seed selection strategies do not seem to be better than randomly picking seed files. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel and generic system, named SmartSeed, to generate seed files towards efficient fuzzing. Specifically, SmartSeed is designed based on a machine learning model to learn and generate high-value binary seeds. We evaluate SmartSeed along with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) on 12 open-source applications with the input formats of mp3, bmp or flv.

From extensive experiments, we find that SmartSeed has the following advantages: First, it only requires tens of seconds to generate sufficient high-value seeds. Second, it can generate seeds with multiple kinds of input formats and significantly improves the fuzzing performance for most applications with the same input format. Third, SmartSeed is compatible to different fuzzing tools. In total, our system discovers more than twice unique crashes and 5,040 extra unique paths than the existing best seed selection strategy for the evaluated 12 applications. From the crashes found by SmartSeed, we discover 16 new vulnerabilities and have received their CVE IDs.

0000-0002-3119-654X,Jing Chen,The University of Hong Kong,Anti-Forgery: Towards a Stealthy and Robust DeepFake Disruption Attack   via Adversarial Perceptual-aware Perturbations,1970,"  DeepFake is becoming a real risk to society and brings potential threats to both individual privacy and political security due to the DeepFaked multimedia are realistic and convincing. However, the popular DeepFake passive detection is an ex-post forensics countermeasure and failed in blocking the disinformation spreading in advance. To address this limitation, researchers study the proactive defense techniques by adding adversarial noises into the source data to disrupt the DeepFake manipulation. However, the existing studies on proactive DeepFake defense via injecting adversarial noises are not robust, which could be easily bypassed by employing simple image reconstruction revealed in a recent study MagDR.   In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of the existing forgery techniques and propose a novel \emph{anti-forgery} technique that helps users protect the shared facial images from attackers who are capable of applying the popular forgery techniques. Our proposed method generates perceptual-aware perturbations in an incessant manner which is vastly different from the prior studies by adding adversarial noises that is sparse. Experimental results reveal that our perceptual-aware perturbations are robust to diverse image transformations, especially the competitive evasion technique, MagDR via image reconstruction. Our findings potentially open up a new research direction towards thorough understanding and investigation of perceptual-aware adversarial attack for protecting facial images against DeepFakes in a proactive and robust manner.

Here, the properties of thick branes generated by a bulk scalar field in the five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity were studied. With the help of the superpotential method, we obtain a series of multi-kink brane solutions. We also analyze the linear stability of the brane system under tensor perturbations and prove that they are stable. The massless graviton is shown to be localized near the brane and hence the four-dimensional Newtonian potential can be recovered. By comparing the properties of these thick branes under different superpotentials we find with some specific choice of superpotential the Gauss-Bonnet term can determine the scalar field are multi-kink or single kink.

Current research has uncovered numerous vulnerabilities in VCS, presenting significant risks to user privacy and security. However, a cohesive and systematic examination of these vulnerabilities and the corresponding solutions is still absent. This lack of comprehensive analysis presents a challenge for VCS designers in fully understanding and mitigating the security issues within these systems.

We classify attacks based on their technical principles and thoroughly evaluate various attributes, such as their methods, targets, vectors, and behaviors. Furthermore, we consolidate and assess the defense mechanisms proposed in current research, offering actionable recommendations for enhancing VCS security. Our work makes a significant contribution by simplifying the complexity inherent in VCS security, aiding designers in effectively identifying and countering potential threats, and setting a foundation for future advancements in VCS security research.

Our discussion is based on a specific SIDM model in which DM particles self-interact via a light scalar mediator, or Yukawa potential, in the context of quantum mechanics. Within this framework, we calculate the self-capture rate across a broad region of parameter space. While the self-capture rate can be obtained separately in the Born regime with perturbative method, and the classical limits with the Rutherford formula, our calculation covers the gap between in a non-perturbative fashion. Besides, the phenomelogy of both the Sommerfeld-enhanced s- and p-wave annihilation of the solar SIDM is also involved in our discussion. Moreover, by combining the analysis of the Super-Kamiokande (SK) data and the observed DM relic density, we constrain the nuclear capture rate of the DM particles in the presence of the dark Yukawa potential. The consequence of the long-range dark force on probing the solar SIDM turns out to be significant if the force-carrier is much lighter than the DM particle, and a quantitative analysis is provided.

0000-0003-1124-2374,Xin Qi,"Peking University, Peking University First Hospital",Relation Modeling and Distillation for Learning with Noisy Labels,1970,"  Learning with noisy labels has become an effective strategy for enhancing the robustness of models, which enables models to better tolerate inaccurate data. Existing methods either focus on optimizing the loss function to mitigate the interference from noise, or design procedures to detect potential noise and correct errors. However, their effectiveness is often compromised in representation learning due to the dilemma where models overfit to noisy labels. To address this issue, this paper proposes a relation modeling and distillation framework that models inter-sample relationships via self-supervised learning and employs knowledge distillation to enhance understanding of latent associations, which mitigate the impact of noisy labels. Specifically, the proposed method, termed RMDNet, includes two main modules, where the relation modeling (RM) module implements the contrastive learning technique to learn representations of all data, an unsupervised approach that effectively eliminates the interference of noisy tags on feature extraction. The relation-guided representation learning (RGRL) module utilizes inter-sample relation learned from the RM module to calibrate the representation distribution for noisy samples, which is capable of improving the generalization of the model in the inference phase. Notably, the proposed RMDNet is a plug-and-play framework that can integrate multiple methods to its advantage. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets, including performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results show that RMDNet can learn discriminative representations for noisy data, which results in superior performance than the existing methods.

However, the data heterogeneity between sources may lead models to gradually forget previously acquired knowledge when undergoing cross-training to adapt to new tasks or data sources. We argue that integrating personalized and global knowledge to gather information from multiple perspectives could potentially improve performance. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel approach that enhances federated learning through a cross-training scheme incorporating multi-view information. Specifically, the proposed method, termed FedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which enhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient federated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and local views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after model exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global knowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich information to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables the model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT alleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables it outperform state-of-the-art methods.

The bond-orientational order parameter $\Phi_{6}$ and the bond-orientational order function $g_B(r)$ are calculated in two-dimensional systems. It is found that a two-stage transition and the hexatic phase are indeed existent in two-dimensional melitng, which is consistent with the prediction of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory. For comparing with the melting process in three-dimensional systems, the probability distribution of single-particle local order parameter is introduced. Based on the extensive simulations, it is qualitatively suggested that the breakdown of local order only occurs on the fractional part of the colloidal systems for the two-dimensional melting, but in three-dimensional melting, this breakdown takes place on the whole systems at the same time.

According to the regularity theory of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation, if the support of the target measure is disconnected or just non-convex, the optimal transportation mapping is discontinuous. General DNNs can only approximate continuous mappings. This intrinsic conflict leads to the convergence difficulty and mode collapse in GANs.   We test our hypothesis that the supports of real data distribution are in general non-convex, therefore the discontinuity is unavoidable using an Autoencoder combined with discrete optimal transportation map (AE-OT framework) on the CelebA data set. The testing result is positive. Furthermore, we propose to approximate the continuous Brenier potential directly based on discrete Brenier theory to tackle mode collapse.

Accordingly, minimizing setup time proves essential in affording users with ample experimental time. We propose a trend-based soft actor-critic(TBSAC) beam control method with strong robustness, allowing the agents to be trained in a simulated environment and applied to the real accelerator directly with zero-shot. To validate the effectiveness of our method, two different typical beam control tasks were performed on China Accelerator Facility for Superheavy Elements (CAFe II) and a light particle injector(LPI) respectively. The orbit correction tasks were performed in three cryomodules in CAFe II seperately, the time required for tuning has been reduced to one-tenth of that needed by human experts, and the RMS values of the corrected orbit were all less than 1mm. The other transmission efficiency optimization task was conducted in the LPI, our agent successfully optimized the transmission efficiency of radio-frequency quadrupole(RFQ) to over $85\%$ within 2 minutes. The outcomes of these two experiments offer substantiation that our proposed TBSAC approach can efficiently and effectively accomplish beam commissioning tasks while upholding the same standard as skilled human experts. As such, our method exhibits potential for future applications in other accelerator commissioning fields.

The introduction of Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) has effectively addressed the illiquidity issue associated with solo staking, gaining significant market attention. This paper analyzes the LSD market dynamics from the perspectives of both liquidity takers (LTs) and liquidity providers (LPs). We first quantify the price discrepancy between the LSD primary and secondary markets. Then we investigate and empirically measure how LTs can leverage such discrepancy to exploit arbitrage opportunities, unveiling the potential barriers to LSD arbitrages. In addition, we evaluate the financial profit and losses experienced by LPs who supply LSDs for liquidity provision.

Solving these domain adaptive transfer learning tasks has the potential to save large efforts on manually labeling data and modifying models for new machines in the same fleet. Although data-driven methods have shown great potential in fault diagnosis applications, their ability to generalize on new machines and new working conditions are limited because of their tendency to overfit to the training set in reality. One promising solution to this problem is to use domain adaptation techniques. It aims to improve model performance on the target new machine. Inspired by its successful implementation in computer vision, we introduced Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to our context, along with two other popular methods existing in previous fault diagnosis research. We then carefully justify the applicability of these methods in realistic fault diagnosis settings, and offer a unified experimental protocol for a fair comparison between domain adaptation methods for fault diagnosis problems.

However, limitations on high latency and low scalability retard their adoptions and applications in classic designs. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently re-build upper layer components including consensus, incentives, \textit{etc.} The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises the DAG technique. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of DAG-based blockchain systems. Through deconstructing open-sourced systems and reviewing academic researches, we conclude the main components and featured properties of systems, and provide the approach to establish a DAG. With this in hand, we analyze the security and performance of several leading systems, followed by discussions and comparisons with concurrent (scaling blockchain) techniques.

To achieve that, we deconstruct the Tangle-based projects (e.g. IOTA) and abstract the main components to rebuild a simple but flexible network for the simulation. Then, we informally define three smallest actions to build up the attack strategies layer by layer. Based on that, we provide analyses to evaluate different types of attacks.

PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due to its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the \textit{unfairness} issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have investigated 2,500+ \textit{in the wild} projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.).

The effectiveness of the AME is assessed in VGG and ResNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that AME exhibits a strong correlation with the accuracy of AM-CNNs, outperforming the other AM error metrics. To predict the accuracy of AM-CNNs, quadratic regression models are constructed based on the AME; the predictions show an average of 3% deviation from the ground-truth values. Compared with a GPU-based simulation, the AME-based prediction is about $10^{6}\times$ faster.

On the one hand, we propose to explicitly learn the task feature correlation to strengthen the target semantic predictions with the help of target depth estimation. On the other hand, we use the depth prediction discrepancy from source and target depth decoders to approximate the pixel-wise adaptation difficulty. The adaptation difficulty, inferred from depth, is then used to refine the target semantic segmentation pseudo-labels. The proposed method can be easily implemented into existing segmentation frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the benchmark tasks SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and GTA-to-Cityscapes, on which we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance of $55.0\%$ and $56.6\%$, respectively.

This incorporation effectively integrates the neighborhood information associated with the directional albedo, thereby facilitating the denoising process. Subsequently, the reconstruction is achieved by optimizing a directional albedo model with SS regularization using fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Notably, the robust reconstruction of occluded objects is observed. Through comprehensive evaluations conducted on both synthetic and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields high-quality reconstructions, surpassing the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, especially in scenarios involving short exposure and low SNR measurements.

Unlike existing representation learning methods that either treat each user preference and item feature uniformly or categorize them into discrete clusters, we argue that in the real world, user preferences and item features are naturally expressed and organized in a hierarchical manner, leading to a new direction for representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel matryoshka representation learning method for recommendation (MRL4Rec), by which we restructure user and item vectors into matryoshka representations with incrementally dimensional and overlapping vector spaces to explicitly represent user preferences and item features at different hierarchical levels. We theoretically establish that constructing training triplets specific to each level is pivotal in guaranteeing accurate matryoshka representation learning. Subsequently, we propose the matryoshka negative sampling mechanism to construct training triplets, which further ensures the effectiveness of the matryoshka representation learning in capturing hierarchical user preferences and item features.

We investigate cutting planes that can be derived using the DW decomposition algorithm and show that these cuts can provide the same dual bounds as DW decomposition. More precisely, we generate one cut for each DW block, and when combined with the constraints in the original formulation, these cuts imply the objective function cut one can simply write using the DW bound. This approach typically leads to a formulation with lower dual degeneracy that consequently has a better computational performance when solved by standard MIP solvers in the original space. We also discuss how to strengthen these cuts to improve the computational performance further. We test our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Assignment Problem and the Temporal Knapsack Problem, and show that the proposed cuts are helpful in accelerating the solution time without the need to implement branch and price.

0000-0002-6249-6780,Rui Chen,Tsinghua University,Deep Multi-View Semi-Supervised Clustering with Sample Pairwise   Constraints,1970,"  Multi-view clustering has attracted much attention thanks to the capacity of multi-source information integration. Although numerous advanced methods have been proposed in past decades, most of them generally overlook the significance of weakly-supervised information and fail to preserve the feature properties of multiple views, thus resulting in unsatisfactory clustering performance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-view Semi-supervised Clustering (DMSC) method, which jointly optimizes three kinds of losses during networks finetuning, including multi-view clustering loss, semi-supervised pairwise constraint loss and multiple autoencoders reconstruction loss. Specifically, a KL divergence based multi-view clustering loss is imposed on the common representation of multi-view data to perform heterogeneous feature optimization, multi-view weighting and clustering prediction simultaneously. Then, we innovatively propose to integrate pairwise constraints into the process of multi-view clustering by enforcing the learned multi-view representation of must-link samples (cannot-link samples) to be similar (dissimilar), such that the formed clustering architecture can be more credible. Moreover, unlike existing rivals that only preserve the encoders for each heterogeneous branch during networks finetuning, we further propose to tune the intact autoencoders frame that contains both encoders and decoders. In this way, the issue of serious corruption of view-specific and view-shared feature space could be alleviated, making the whole training procedure more stable. Through comprehensive experiments on eight popular image datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach performs better than the state-of-the-art multi-view and single-view competitors.

0000-0002-6249-6780,Rui Chen,Tsinghua University,Online Decision Making with Nonconvex Local and Convex Global   Constraints,1970,"  We study the online decision making problem (ODMP) as a natural generalization of online linear programming. In ODMP, a single decision maker undertakes a sequence of decisions over $T$ time steps. At each time step, the decision maker makes a locally feasible decision based on information available up to that point. The objective is to maximize the accumulated reward while satisfying some convex global constraints called goal constraints. The decision made at each step results in an $m$-dimensional vector that represents the contribution of this local decision to the goal constraints. In the online setting, these goal constraints are soft constraints that can be violated moderately. To handle potential nonconvexity and nonlinearity in ODMP, we propose a Fenchel dual-based online algorithm. At each time step, the algorithm requires solving a potentially nonconvex optimization problem over the local feasible set and a convex optimization problem over the goal set. Under certain stochastic input models, we show that the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{mT})$ goal constraint violation deterministically, and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{mT})$ regret in expected reward. Numerical experiments on an online knapsack problem and an assortment optimization problem are conducted to demonstrate the potential of our proposed online algorithm.

Current AVs lack social awareness, causing behavior that is often awkward or unsafe. To combat this, social AVs, which are proactive rather than reactive in their behavior, have been explored in recent years. With knowledge of robot-human interaction dynamics, a social AV can influence a human driver to exhibit desired behaviors by strategically altering its own behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel framework for achieving human influence. The foundation of our framework lies in an innovative use of control barrier functions to formulate the desired objectives of influence as constraints in an optimal control problem. The computed controls gradually push the system state toward satisfaction of the objectives, e.g. slowing the human down to some desired speed. We demonstrate the proposed framework's feasibility in a variety of scenarios related to car-following and lane changes, including multi-robot and multi-human configurations. In two case studies, we validate the framework's effectiveness when applied to the problems of traffic flow optimization and aggressive behavior mitigation. Given these results, the main contribution of our framework is its versatility in a wide spectrum of influence objectives and mixed-autonomy configurations.

0000-0002-6249-6780,Rui Chen,Tsinghua University,Light-enhanced nonlinear Hall effect,1970,"  It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.

Very recently, the LHCb Collaboration observed a very narrow doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$ in the $D^0D^0\pi$ mass spectrum, which lies just below the $D^0D^{*+}$ threshold around 273 keV. In this work, we study the $D^0D^{*+}/D^+D^{*0}$ interactions with the one-boson-exchange effective potentials and consider the isospin breaking effect carefully. We not only reproduce the mass of the newly observed $T_{cc}^+$ very well in the doubly charmed molecular tetraquark scenario, but also predict the other doubly charmed partner resonance $T_{cc}^{\prime+}$ with $m=3876~\text{MeV}$, and $\Gamma= 412~\text{keV}$. The prime decay modes of the $T_{cc}^{\prime+}$ are $D^0D^+\gamma$ and $D^+D^0\pi^0$. The peculiar characteristic mass spectrum of the $D^0D^{*+}/D^+D^{*0}$ molecular systems can be applied to identify the doubly charmed molecular states.

A major concern is safety, in another word, constraint satisfaction. State-wise constraints are one of the most common constraints in real-world applications and one of the most challenging constraints in Safe RL. Enforcing state-wise constraints is necessary and essential to many challenging tasks such as autonomous driving, robot manipulation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing approaches that address state-wise constraints in RL. Under the framework of State-wise Constrained Markov Decision Process (SCMDP), we will discuss the connections, differences, and trade-offs of existing approaches in terms of (i) safety guarantee and scalability, (ii) safety and reward performance, and (iii) safety after convergence and during training.

Using a combination of analytical and numerical calculations, we show that the non-Hermitian intra-cell hoppings in the SSH model can modify the localization lengths of bulk and end states, giving rise to a complex finite-size energy gap that exhibits an oscillating exponential decay as the chain length grows. However, the imaginary staggered on-site potentials in the SSH model only change the end-state energy, leaving the localization lengths of the system unchanged. In this case, the finite-size energy gap can undergo a transition from real values to imaginary values. We observed similar phenomena for the finite-size effect in 2D Chern insulator systems.

Two types of TDIEs are considered: The first equation, which is termed the time domain potential integral equation (TDPIE) (in unknowns velocity potential and its normal derivative), suffers from the interior resonance problem, i.e., its solution is replete with spurious modes that are excited at the resonance frequencies of the acoustic cavity in the shape of the scatterer. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, unlike the frequency-domain integral equations, the amplitude of these modes in the time domain could be suppressed to a level that does not significantly affect the solution. The second equation is obtained by linearly combining TDPIE with its normal derivative. Weights of the combination are carefully selected to enable the numerical computation of the singular integrals. The solution of this equation, which is termed the time domain combined potential integral equation (TDCPIE), does not involve any spurious interior resonance modes.

After taking into account the $S-D$ wave mixing and the coupled channel effects, we predict several possible doubly charmed molecular pentaquarks, which include the $\Sigma_cD$ with $I(J^P) = 1/2(1/2^-)$, $\Sigma_c^*D$ with $1/2(3/2^-)$, and $\Sigma_cD^*$ with $1/2(1/2^-)$, $1/2(3/2^-)$. The $\Sigma_cD$ state with $3/2(1/2^-)$ and $\Sigma_cD^*$ state with $3/2(1/2^-)$ may also be suggested as candidates of doubly charmed molecular pentaquarks. The $\Sigma_cD$ and $\Sigma_c^*D$ states can be searched for by analyzing the $\Lambda_cD\pi$ invariant mass spectrum of the bottom baryon and $B$ meson decays. The $\Sigma_cD^*$ states can be searched for in the invariant mass spectrum of $\Lambda_cD^*\pi$, $\Lambda_cD\pi\pi$ and $\Lambda_cD\pi\gamma$. Since the width of $\Sigma_c^*$ is much larger than that of $D^*$, $\Sigma_c^*D\rightarrow \Lambda_cD\pi$ will be the dominant decay mode. We sincerely hope these candidates for the doubly charmed molecular pentaqurks will be searched by LHCb or BelleII collaboration in the near future.

The fundamental building block of such programmable PICs is a tunable 2 x 2 switch, traditionally controlled by the thermo-optic or free-carrier dispersion. Yet, these implementations are power-hungry, volatile, and have a large footprint (typically > 100 um). Therefore, a truly 'set-and-forget' type 2 x 2 switch with zero static power consumption is highly desirable for large-scale PICs. Here, we report a broadband nonvolatile electrically programmable 2 x 2 silicon photonic switch based on the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5. The directional coupler switch exhibits a compact coupling length (64 um), small insertion loss (<2 dB), and minimal crosstalk (<-8 dB) across the entire telecommunication C-band while maintaining a record-high endurance of over 2,800 switching cycles.

A theory of the nonlinear Hall effect on a disordered lattice is a crucial step towards explorations in realistic devices, but has not been addressed. We study the nonlinear Hall response on a lattice, which allows us to introduce strong disorder numerically. We reveal a disorder-induced fluctuation of the Berry curvature that was not discovered in the previous perturbation theories. The fluctuating Berry curvature induces a fluctuation of the nonlinear Hall conductivity, which anomalously increases as the Fermi energy moves from the band edges to higher energies. More importantly, the fluctuation may explain those observations in the recent experiments. We also discover an ""Anderson localization"" of the nonlinear Hall effect. This work shows a territory of the nonlinear Hall effect yet to be explored. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0ED0FF60>,Yes,potent(1)

In this paper, we propose a service delay efficient FL (SDEFL) scheme over mobile devices. Unlike traditional communication efficient FL, which regards wireless communications as the bottleneck, we find that under many situations, the local computing delay is comparable to the communication delay during the FL training process, given the development of high-speed wireless transmission techniques. Thus, the service delay in FL should be computing delay + communication delay over training rounds. To minimize the service delay of FL, simply reducing local computing/communication delay independently is not enough. The delay trade-off between local computing and wireless communications must be considered. Besides, we empirically study the impacts of local computing control and compression strategies (i.e., the number of local updates, weight quantization, and gradient quantization) on computing, communication and service delays. Based on those trade-off observation and empirical studies, we develop an optimization scheme to minimize the service delay of FL over heterogeneous devices. We establish testbeds and conduct extensive emulations/experiments to verify our theoretical analysis. The results show that SDEFL reduces notable service delay with a small accuracy drop compared to peer designs.

At the heart of our method lies a transformer-based Conditional Autoregressive Motion Diffusion Model (CAMDM), which takes as input the character's historical motion and can generate a range of diverse potential future motions conditioned on high-level, coarse user control. To meet the demands for diversity, controllability, and computational efficiency required by a real-time controller, we incorporate several key algorithmic designs. These include separate condition tokenization, classifier-free guidance on past motion, and heuristic future trajectory extension, all designed to address the challenges associated with taming motion diffusion probabilistic models for character control.

We perform a dynamical calculation of the possible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with triple strangeness by the one-boson-exchange model, where the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect are taken into account in our calculation. Our results suggest that the $\Omega_{c}\bar D_s^*$ state with $J^P={3}/{2}^{-}$ and the $\Omega_{c}^{*}\bar D_s^*$ state with $J^P={5}/{2}^{-}$ can be recommended as the candidates of the hidden-charm molecular pentaquark with triple strangeness. Furthermore, we discuss the two-body hidden-charm strong decay behaviors of these possible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with triple strangeness by adopting the quark-interchange model. These predictions are expected to be tested at the LHCb, which can be as a potential research issue with more accumulated experimental data in near future.

The roadside perception technology, a critical aspect of smart roads, utilizes various sensors, roadside units (RSUs), and edge computing devices to gather real-time traffic data for vehicle-road cooperation. However, the full potential of smart roads in improving the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles only can be realized through the mass deployment of roadside perception and communication devices. On the one hand, roadside devices require significant investment but can only achieve monitoring function currently, resulting in no profitability for investors. On the other hand, drivers lack trust in the safety of autonomous driving technology, making it difficult to promote large-scale commercial applications. To deal with the dilemma of mass deployment, we propose a novel smart-road vehicle-guiding architecture for vehicle-road cooperative autonomous driving, based on which we then propose the corresponding business model and analyze its benefits from both operator and driver perspectives. The numerical simulations validate that our proposed smart road solution can enhance driving safety and traffic efficiency. Moreover, we utilize the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) model to assess the economic advantages of the proposed business model which indicates that the smart highway that can provide vehicle-guided-driving services for autonomous vehicles yields more profit than the regular highway.

Existing learning-based solutions mainly focus on visual affordance learning or other pre-trained visual models to guide manipulation policies, which face challenges for novel instances in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel part-guided 3D RL framework, which can learn to manipulate articulated objects without demonstrations. We combine the strengths of 2D segmentation and 3D RL to improve the efficiency of RL policy training. To improve the stability of the policy on real robots, we design a Frame-consistent Uncertainty-aware Sampling (FUS) strategy to get a condensed and hierarchical 3D representation. In addition, a single versatile RL policy can be trained on multiple articulated object manipulation tasks simultaneously in simulation and shows great generalizability to novel categories and instances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and real-world settings.

Reconstructing these structures from images constitutes a pivotal research area in computer vision. However, the complex topology and ambiguous image evidence render this process a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce DeepBranchTracer, a novel method that learns both external image features and internal geometric characteristics to reconstruct curvilinear structures. Firstly, we formulate the curvilinear structures extraction as a geometric attribute estimation problem. Then, a curvilinear structure feature learning network is designed to extract essential branch attributes, including the image features of centerline and boundary, and the geometric features of direction and radius. Finally, utilizing a multi-feature fusion tracing strategy, our model iteratively traces the entire branch by integrating the extracted image and geometric features. We extensively evaluated our model on both 2D and 3D datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing segmentation and reconstruction methods in terms of accuracy and continuity.

We have evaluated the performance of the data converters in the Xilinx ZU28DR RFSoC, which are 12-bit, 8-fold interleaved converters with a maximum sample speed of 4.096 Giga-sample per second (GSPS). We measured the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), signal-to-noise and distortion (SINAD), effective number of bits (ENOB), intermodulation distortion (IMD) and cross-talk between adjacent channels over the bandwidth of 2.048 GHz. We both captured data for off-line analysis with floating-point arithmetic, and implemented a real-time integer arithmetic spectrometer on the RFSoC. The performance of the ADCs is sufficient for radio astronomy applications and close to the vendor specifications in most of the scenarios.

For inter-frame coding, Fractional Motion Estimation (FME) still has a high computational effort, which limits the real-time processing capability of the video encoder. In this context, this paper proposes an error-surface-based FME algorithm and the corresponding hardware implementation. The algorithm creates an error surface constructed by the Rate-Distortion (R-D) cost of the integer motion vector (IMV) and its neighbors. This method requires no iteration and interpolation, thus reducing the area and power consumption and increasing the throughput of the hardware. The experimental results show that the corresponding BDBR loss is only 0.47% compared to VTM 16.0 in LD-P configuration. The hardware implementation was synthesized using GF 28nm process. It can support 13 different sizes of CU varying from 128x128 to 8x8. The measured throughput can reach 4K@30fps at 400MHz, with a gate count of 192k and power consumption of 12.64 mW.

A Preliminary Study,1970,"  Recommendation systems have witnessed significant advancements and have been widely used over the past decades. However, most traditional recommendation methods are task-specific and therefore lack efficient generalization ability. Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has significantly advanced NLP tasks by enhancing the capabilities of conversational models. Nonetheless, the application of ChatGPT in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we employ ChatGPT as a general-purpose recommendation model to explore its potential for transferring extensive linguistic and world knowledge acquired from large-scale corpora to recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we design a set of prompts and evaluate ChatGPT's performance on five recommendation scenarios. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, we do not fine-tune ChatGPT during the entire evaluation process, relying only on the prompts themselves to convert recommendation tasks into natural language tasks. Further, we explore the use of few-shot prompting to inject interaction information that contains user potential interest to help ChatGPT better understand user needs and interests. Comprehensive experimental results on Amazon Beauty dataset show that ChatGPT has achieved promising results in certain tasks and is capable of reaching the baseline level in others. We conduct human evaluations on two explainability-oriented tasks to more accurately evaluate the quality of contents generated by different models. And the human evaluations show ChatGPT can truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results. We hope that our study can inspire researchers to further explore the potential of language models like ChatGPT to improve recommendation performance and contribute to the advancement of the recommendation systems field.

Due to the fact that transactions to smart contracts commonly involve cryptocurrency transfer, any successful attacks can lead to money loss or even financial disorder. In this paper, we focus on the overflow attacks in Ethereum , mainly because they widely rooted in many smart contracts and comparatively easy to exploit. We have developed EASYFLOW , an overflow detector at Ethereum Virtual Machine level. The key insight behind EASYFLOW is a taint analysis based tracking technique to analyze the propagation of involved taints. Specifically, EASYFLOW can not only divide smart contracts into safe contracts, manifested overflows, well-protected overflows and potential overflows, but also automatically generate transactions to trigger potential overflows.

Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participants funds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before. A video of BLOCKEYE is available at https://youtu.be/7DjsWBLdlQU.

The $F_{\rm H\delta}/F_{\rm H\gamma}$ flux ratio increases from less than unity to five as stars cool down from M0 to M10, which is likely driven by increasing TiO absorption above the deepest shock-emitting regions. We also discuss the relationship between the equivalent widths of the Balmer emission lines and the photometric luminosity phase of our Mira sample stars. Using our 291 Mira spectra as templates for reference, 191 Mira candidates are newly identified from the LAMOST DR4 catalog. We summarize the criteria adopted to select Mira candidates based on emission-line indices and molecular absorption bands. This enlarged spectral sample of Mira variables has the potential to contribute significantly to our knowledge of the optical properties of Mira stars and will facilitate further studies of these late-type, long-period variables.

Local structure tensors with multiple scales are widely used in local feature extraction. Our research indicates that the current corner detection method based on Gabor wavelets can not effectively apply to complex scenes. In this work, the capability of the Gabor function to discriminate the intensity changes of step edges, L-shaped corners, Y-shaped or T-shaped corners, X-shaped corners, and star-shaped corners are investigated. The properties of Gabor wavelets to suppress affine image transformation are investigated and obtained. Many properties for edges and corners were discovered, which prompted us to propose a new corner extraction method. To fully use the structural information from the tuned Gabor filters, a novel multi-directional structure tensor is constructed for corner detection, and a multi-scale corner measurement function is proposed to remove false candidate corners. Furthermore, we compare the proposed method with twelve current state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit optimal performance and practical application to 3D reconstruction with good application potential.

0000-0002-0078-5982,Chao Liu,Zhejiang University,The North/South Asymmetry of the Galaxy: Possible Connection to the   Vertical Phase Space Snail,1970,"  The Galaxy is found to be in disequilibrium based on recent findings of the North/South (N/S) asymmetry and the phase mixing signatures, such as a phase spiral (snail) structure in the vertical phase space ($z-V_{z}$). We show that the N/S asymmetry in a tracer population of dwarfs may be quantitatively modeled with a simple phase snail model superimposed on a smooth equilibrium background. As the phase snail intersects with the $z$ axis, the number density is enhanced, and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{z}$) is decreased relative to the other side of the Galactic plane. Fitting only to the observed asymmetric N/S $\sigma_{z}$ profiles, we obtain reasonable parameters for the phase space snail and the potential utilized in modeling the background, despite the complex dependence of the model on the potential parameters and the significant selection effects of the data. Both the snail shape and the N/S number density difference given by our best-fit model are consistent with previous observations. The equilibrium background implies a local dark matter density of $0.0151^{+0.0050}_{-0.0051}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-3}$. The vertical bulk motion of our model is similar to the observation, but with a $\sim$1.2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$ shift. Our work demonstrates the strong correlation between the phase space snail and the N/S asymmetry. Future observational constraints will facilitate more comprehensive snail models to unravel the Milky Way potential and the perturbation history encoded in the snail feature.

We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in-situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex situ (via accretion). We find that $45.3\%$ have formed in situ, $38.4\%$ may be related to known merger events: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the Helmi streams, the Sequoia galaxy, and the Kraken galaxy. We also further identify three new sub-structures associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The remaining $16.3\%$ of GCs are unrelated to the known mergers and thought to be from small accretion events. We select 46 GCs which have radii $8.0<r<37.3$ kpc and obtain the anisotropy parameter $\beta=0.315_{-0.049}^{+0.055}$, which is lower than the recent result using the sample of GCs in Gaia Data Release 2, but still in agreement with it by considering the error bar. By using the same sample, we obtain the MW mass inside the outermost GC as $M(<37.3 kpc)=0.423_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding $M_{200}=1.11_{-0.18}^{+0.25}\times10^{12}M_{\odot}$. The estimated mass is consistent with the results in many recent studies. We also find that the estimated $\beta$ and mass depend on the selected sample of GCs.

It is well known that collaborative filtering is one of the most popular methods for service recommendation based on QoS, and many existing proposals focus on improving recommendation accuracy, i.e., recommending high-quality redundant services. Nevertheless, users may have different requirements on QoS, and hence diversified recommendation has been attracting increasing attention in recent years to fulfill users' diverse demands and to explore potential services. Unfortunately, the recommendation performances relies on a large volume of data (e.g., QoS data), whereas the data may be distributed across multiple platforms. Therefore, to enable data sharing across the different platforms for diversified service recommendation, we propose a Privacy-preserving Diversified Service Recommendation (PDSR) method. Specifically, we innovate in leveraging the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) mechanism such that privacy-preserved data sharing across different platforms is enabled to construct a service similarity graph. Based on the similarity graph, we propose a novel accuracy-diversity metric and design a $2$-approximation algorithm to select $K$ services to recommend by maximizing the accuracy-diversity measure. Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to verify the efficacy of our PDSR method.

More specifically we analyze the vertical velocity dispersion profiles ($\sigma_{v_{z}}(z$)) in different bins of $R$ ($R_\mathrm{g}$) and $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. We find troughs in the profiles of $\sigma_{v_{z}}(z)$ located in both the North ($z \sim 0.7$\,kpc) and South ($z \sim -0.5$\,kpc) of the disk at all radial and chemical bins studied. The difference between the Northern and Southern vertical velocity dispersion profiles ($\Delta\sigma_{v_{z}}(|z|)$) shows a shift between curves of different $R$ and $R_\mathrm{g}$. A similar shift exists in these NS asymmetry profiles further divided into different $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ ranges. The sample binned with $R_\mathrm{g}$ more clearly displays the features in the velocity dispersion profiles. The shift in the peaks of the $\Delta\sigma_{v_{z}}$ profiles and the variation in the phase spiral shape binned by metallicity indicate the variation of the vertical potential profiles and the radial metallicity gradient. The wave-like signal in NS asymmetry of $\sigma_{v_{z}}(z)$ largely originates from phase spiral; while the NS asymmetry profiles of [Fe/H] only display a weak wave-like feature near solar radius. We perform a test particle simulation to qualitatively reproduce the observed results. A quantitative explanation of the NS asymmetry in the metallicity profile needs careful consideration of the spiral shape and the perturbation model, and we leave this for future work.

Although, in general, red clump stars are considered as the standard candle, they do not exactly stay in a narrow range of absolute magnitude, but may extend to more than 1 magnitude depending on their initial mass. Consequently, conventional oversimplified distance estimations with assumption of fixed luminosity may lead to systematic bias related to the initial mass or the age, which may potentially affect the study of the evolution of the Galaxy with red clump stars. We therefore employ an isochrone-based method to estimate the absolute magnitude of red clump stars from their observed surface gravities, effective temperatures, and metallicities. We verify that the estimation well removes the systematics and provide an initial mass/age independent distance estimates with accuracy less than 10%.

However, concerns about their trustworthiness remain unresolved, particularly in addressing ""jailbreaking"" attacks on aligned LLMs. Previous research predominantly relies on scenarios with white-box LLMs or specific and fixed prompt templates, which are often impractical and lack broad applicability. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward and novel method, named ObscurePrompt, for jailbreaking LLMs, inspired by the observed fragile alignments in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Specifically, we first formulate the decision boundary in the jailbreaking process and then explore how obscure text affects LLM's ethical decision boundary. ObscurePrompt starts with constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques. Powerful LLMs are then utilized to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations, aiming to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness, maintaining efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms. We believe that our work can offer fresh insights for future research on enhancing LLM alignment.

However, when it comes to some foundation models like Segment Anything, there is still a challenge in performing well on out-of-distribution data, including camouflaged and medical images. Inconsistent prompting strategies during fine-tuning and testing further compound the issue, leading to decreased performance. Drawing inspiration from how human cognition processes new environments, we introduce SlotSAM, a method that reconstructs features from the encoder in a self-supervised manner to create object-centric representations. These representations are then integrated into the foundation model, bolstering its object-level perceptual capabilities while reducing the impact of distribution-related variables. The beauty of SlotSAM lies in its simplicity and adaptability to various tasks, making it a versatile solution that significantly enhances the generalization abilities of foundation models. Through limited parameter fine-tuning in a bootstrap manner, our approach paves the way for improved generalization in novel environments. The code is available at github.com/lytang63/SlotSAM.

However, studies focus on learning a robust global model or personalized classifiers, which yield divergence due to inconsistent objectives. This paper shows that it is possible to achieve flexible personalization after the convergence of the global model by introducing representation learning. In this paper, we first analyze and determine that non-IID data harms representation learning of the global model. Existing FL methods adhere to the scheme of jointly learning representations and classifiers, where the global model is an average of classification-based local models that are consistently subject to heterogeneity from non-IID data. As a solution, we separate representation learning from classification learning in FL and propose RepPer, an independent two-stage personalized FL framework.We first learn the client-side feature representation models that are robust to non-IID data and aggregate them into a global common representation model. After that, we achieve personalization by learning a classifier head for each client, based on the common representation obtained at the former stage. Notably, the proposed two-stage learning scheme of RepPer can be potentially used for lightweight edge computing that involves devices with constrained computation power.Experiments on various datasets (CIFAR-10/100, CINIC-10) and heterogeneous data setup show that RepPer outperforms alternatives in flexibility and personalization on non-IID data.

In this paper, we propose the first deep learning model for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. We achieve information sharing through feature sharing units, which significantly reduces the number of parameters. The feature sharing unit is combined with a data fidelity unit to comprise an inference block. These inference blocks are cascaded with dense connections, which allows for information transmission across different depths of the network efficiently. Our extensive experiments on various multi-contrast MRI datasets show that proposed model outperforms both state-of-the-art single-contrast and multi-contrast MRI methods in accuracy and efficiency.

However, labeling the lesion in medical images is laborious requiring highly specialized knowledge. We propose a medical image synthesis model named abnormal-to-normal translation generative adversarial network (ANT-GAN) to generate a normal-looking medical image based on its abnormal-looking counterpart without the need for paired training data. Unlike typical GANs, whose aim is to generate realistic samples with variations, our more restrictive model aims at producing a normal-looking image corresponding to one containing lesions, and thus requires a special design. Being able to provide a ""normal"" counterpart to a medical image can provide useful side information for medical imaging tasks like lesion segmentation or classification validated by our experiments. In the other aspect, the ANT-GAN model is also capable of producing highly realistic lesion-containing image corresponding to the healthy one, which shows the potential in data augmentation verified in our experiments.

In urban areas, sparsity priors are generally enforced during the tomographic inversion process in order to retrieve the location of scatterers seen within a given radar resolution cell. However, such priors often miss parts of the urban surfaces. Those missing parts are typically regions of flat areas such as ground or rooftops.

Different from DGOD trained on multiple source domains, Single-DGOD is far more challenging to generalize well to multiple target domains with only one single source domain. Existing methods mostly adopt a similar treatment from DGOD to learn domain-invariant features by decoupling or compressing the semantic space. However, there may have two potential limitations: 1) pseudo attribute-label correlation, due to extremely scarce single-domain data; and 2) the semantic structural information is usually ignored, i.e., we found the affinities of instance-level semantic relations in samples are crucial to model generalization. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Reasoning with Compound Domains (SRCD) for Single-DGOD. Specifically, our SRCD contains two main components, namely, the texture-based self-augmentation (TBSA) module, and the local-global semantic reasoning (LGSR) module. TBSA aims to eliminate the effects of irrelevant attributes associated with labels, such as light, shadow, color, etc., at the image level by a light-yet-efficient self-augmentation. Moreover, LGSR is used to further model the semantic relationships on instance features to uncover and maintain the intrinsic semantic structures.

In this paper, we study a practical problem of Domain Generalization under Category Shift (DGCS), which aims to simultaneously detect unknown-class samples and classify known-class samples in the target domains. Compared to prior DG works, we face two new challenges: 1) how to learn the concept of ``unknown'' during training with only source known-class samples, and 2) how to adapt the source-trained model to unseen environments for safe model deployment. To this end, we propose a novel Activate and Reject (ART) framework to reshape the model's decision boundary to accommodate unknown classes and conduct post hoc modification to further discriminate known and unknown classes using unlabeled test data. Specifically, during training, we promote the response to the unknown by optimizing the unknown probability and then smoothing the overall output to mitigate the overconfidence issue. At test time, we introduce a step-wise online adaptation method that predicts the label by virtue of the cross-domain nearest neighbor and class prototype information without updating the network's parameters or using threshold-based mechanisms. Experiments reveal that ART consistently improves the generalization capability of deep networks on different vision tasks. For image classification, ART improves the H-score by 6.1% on average compared to the previous best method.

However, for safe and effective real-world deployments, ensuring honesty and helpfulness is critical. This paper addresses the question: Can we prioritize the helpfulness of LLMs while preserving their honesty? To begin with, we establish exhaustive principles aimed at guaranteeing the honesty of LLM. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, referred to as HoneSet, comprising 930 queries spanning six categories meticulously crafted to assess an LLM's capacity for maintaining honesty. Subsequently, we present two approaches to augmenting honesty and helpfulness in LLMs: a training-free enhancement and a fine-tuning-based improvement. The training-free approach, which is based on curiosity-driven prompting, empowers LLMs to articulate internal confusion and uncertainty regarding queries, thereby optimizing their responses. Conversely, the fine-tuning-based method employs a two-stage process inspired by curriculum learning: initially instructing LLMs to discern between honest and dishonest responses, then refining their training to enhance helpfulness. Experiments conducted on nine prominent LLMs demonstrate a significant improvement in alignment with honesty across all models through the implementation of our proposed enhancements. Particularly noteworthy is the 65.3% enhancement observed in Llama3-8b and the remarkable 124.7% improvement in Mistral-7b, as measured by the H$^{2}$ (honest and helpful) assessment. We believe that our work can pave the way for developing more trustworthy LLMs for real-world applications.

However, it still faces the challenges of domain shift problem and has difficulty accurately generalizing to unknown target domains. This limitation occurs because the model relies heavily on primary domain-invariant features in the training data and pays less attention to potentially valuable secondary features. To solve this complex and common problem, this paper proposes the two-stage Multi-expert Knowledge Confrontation and Collaboration (MiKeCoCo) method, which incorporates multiple experts with unique perspectives into Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and fully leverages high-level semantic knowledge for comprehensive feature representation. Specifically, we propose to construct the learnable prompt set of all specific-perspective experts by adversarial learning in the latent space of visual features during the first stage of training. The learned prompt set with high-level semantics is then utilized to guide representation learning of the multi-level features for final knowledge fusion in the next stage. In this process of knowledge fusion, although multiple experts employ different assessment ways to examine the same vehicle, their common goal is to confirm the vehicle's true identity. Their collective decision can ensure the accuracy and consistency of the evaluation results. Furthermore, we design different image inputs for two-stage training, which include image component separation and diversity enhancement in order to extract the ID-related prompt representation and to obtain feature representation highlighted by all experts, respectively.

However, current agents primarily exhibit excellent understanding capabilities in static environments and are predominantly applied in relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content.

Recently, many studies have focused on the tool utilization ability of LLMs. They primarily investigated how LLMs effectively collaborate with given specific tools. However, in scenarios where LLMs serve as intelligent agents, as seen in applications like AutoGPT and MetaGPT, LLMs are expected to engage in intricate decision-making processes that involve deciding whether to employ a tool and selecting the most suitable tool(s) from a collection of available tools to fulfill user requests. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce MetaTool, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether LLMs have tool usage awareness and can correctly choose tools. Specifically, we create a dataset called ToolE within the benchmark. This dataset contains various types of user queries in the form of prompts that trigger LLMs to use tools, including both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios. Subsequently, we set the tasks for both tool usage awareness and tool selection. We define four subtasks from different perspectives in tool selection, including tool selection with similar choices, tool selection in specific scenarios, tool selection with possible reliability issues, and multi-tool selection. We conduct experiments involving eight popular LLMs and find that the majority of them still struggle to effectively select tools, highlighting the existing gaps between LLMs and genuine intelligent agents.

0000-0002-3623-834X,Jiacheng Liu,The University of Hong Kong,Phrase Grounding by Soft-Label Chain Conditional Random Field,1970,"  The phrase grounding task aims to ground each entity mention in a given caption of an image to a corresponding region in that image. Although there are clear dependencies between how different mentions of the same caption should be grounded, previous structured prediction methods that aim to capture such dependencies need to resort to approximate inference or non-differentiable losses. In this paper, we formulate phrase grounding as a sequence labeling task where we treat candidate regions as potential labels, and use neural chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to model dependencies among regions for adjacent mentions. In contrast to standard sequence labeling tasks, the phrase grounding task is defined such that there may be multiple correct candidate regions. To address this multiplicity of gold labels, we define so-called Soft-Label Chain CRFs, and present an algorithm that enables convenient end-to-end training. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on phrase grounding on the Flickr30k Entities dataset. Analysis shows that our model benefits both from the entity dependencies captured by the CRF and from the soft-label training regime.

We propose DiffPop, the first framework that utilizes plausibility-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the scale and spatial relations among multiple objects and the corresponding scene image. First, we train an unguided diffusion model to directly learn the object placement parameters in a self-supervised manner. Then, we develop a human-in-the-loop pipeline which exploits human labeling on the diffusion-generated composite images to provide the weak supervision for training a structural plausibility classifier. The classifier is further used to guide the diffusion sampling process towards generating the plausible object placement. Experimental results verify the superiority of our method for producing plausible and diverse composite images on the new Cityscapes-OP dataset and the public OPA dataset, as well as demonstrate its potential in applications such as data augmentation and multi-object placement tasks.

In this study, we introduce a novel investment strategy model, anchored on the 'lazy factor.' Our approach bifurcates into a Price Portfolio Forecasting Model and a Mean-Variance Model with Transaction Costs, utilizing probability weights as the coefficients of laziness factors. The Price Portfolio Forecasting Model, leveraging the EXPMA Mean Method, plots the long-term price trend line and forecasts future price movements, incorporating the tangent slope and rate of change. For short-term investments, we apply the ARIMA Model to predict ensuing prices. The Mean-Variance Model with Transaction Costs employs the Monte Carlo Method to formulate the feasible region. To strike an optimal balance between risk and return, equal probability weights are incorporated as coefficients of the laziness factor. To assess the efficacy of this combined strategy, we executed extensive experiments on a specified dataset.

However, existing implementations, including ""chain-of-thought"" and its variants, fall short in capturing the introspective nature of knowledge required in commonsense reasoning, and in accounting for the mutual adaptation between the generation and utilization of knowledge. We propose a novel method to develop an introspective commonsense reasoner, Crystal. To tackle commonsense problems, it first introspects for knowledge statements related to the given question, and subsequently makes an informed prediction that is grounded in the previously introspected knowledge. The knowledge introspection and knowledge-grounded reasoning modes of the model are tuned via reinforcement learning to mutually adapt, where the reward derives from the feedback given by the model itself. Experiments show that Crystal significantly outperforms both the standard supervised finetuning and chain-of-thought distilled methods, and enhances the transparency of the commonsense reasoning process.

The recent incursion of attention mechanisms, originally an artifact of Natural Language Processing (NLP), into the realm of graph learning has spearheaded a notable shift in research trends. Consequently, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Attention Auto-Encoders have emerged as preferred tools for graph clustering tasks. Yet, these methods primarily employ a local attention mechanism, thereby curbing their capacity to apprehend the intricate global dependencies between nodes within graphs. Addressing these impediments, this study introduces an innovative method known as the Graph Transformer Auto-Encoder for Graph Clustering (GTAGC). By melding the Graph Auto-Encoder with the Graph Transformer, GTAGC is adept at capturing global dependencies between nodes. This integration amplifies the graph representation and surmounts the constraints posed by the local attention mechanism. The architecture of GTAGC encompasses graph embedding, integration of the Graph Transformer within the autoencoder structure, and a clustering component. It strategically alternates between graph embedding and clustering, thereby tailoring the Graph Transformer for clustering tasks, whilst preserving the graph's global structural information. Through extensive experimentation on diverse benchmark datasets, GTAGC has exhibited superior performance against existing state-of-the-art graph clustering methodologies.

So do human annotators when curating labels for named entity recognition (NER). Such label mistakes might hurt model training and interfere model comparison. In this study, we dive deep into one of the widely-adopted NER benchmark datasets, CoNLL03 NER. We are able to identify label mistakes in about 5.38% test sentences, which is a significant ratio considering that the state-of-the-art test F1 score is already around 93%. Therefore, we manually correct these label mistakes and form a cleaner test set. Our re-evaluation of popular models on this corrected test set leads to more accurate assessments, compared to those on the original test set. More importantly, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CrossWeigh, to handle label mistakes during NER model training. Specifically, it partitions the training data into several folds and train independent NER models to identify potential mistakes in each fold. Then it adjusts the weights of training data accordingly to train the final NER model.

Trained on ~7M commonsense statements created from 19 QA datasets and two large-scale knowledge bases, and with a combination of three training objectives, Vera is a versatile model that effectively separates correct from incorrect statements across diverse commonsense domains. When applied to solving commonsense problems in the verification format, Vera substantially outperforms existing models that can be repurposed for commonsense verification, and it further exhibits generalization capabilities to unseen tasks and provides well-calibrated outputs.

However, these benchmarks typically focus solely on news pertaining to a single semantic topic or originating from a single platform, thereby failing to capture the diversity of multi-domain news in real scenarios. In order to understand fake news across various domains, the external knowledge and fine-grained annotations are indispensable to provide precise evidence and uncover the diverse underlying strategies for fabrication, which are also ignored by existing benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-domain knowledge-enhanced benchmark with fine-grained annotations, named \textbf{FineFake}. FineFake encompasses 16,909 data samples spanning six semantic topics and eight platforms. Each news item is enriched with multi-modal content, potential social context, semi-manually verified common knowledge, and fine-grained annotations that surpass conventional binary labels. Furthermore, we formulate three challenging tasks based on FineFake and propose a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network.

This paper comprehensively investigates terahertz channel performance under such conditions, employing a measurement setup operational between 113 and 170 GHz. Analyzing scenarios frequently induced by human activity and environmental factors, like door movements, we established a comprehensive theoretical model. This model seamlessly integrates transmission, reflection, absorption, and diffraction mechanisms, leveraging the Fresnel formula, multi-layer transmission paradigm, and knife-edge diffraction theory. Our experimental results and theoretical predictions harmoniously align, revealing intricate dependencies, such as increased power loss at higher frequencies and larger incident angles. Furthermore, door interactions, whether opening or oscillations, significantly impact the terahertz channel. Notably, door edges lead to a power blockage surpassing the transmission loss of the glass itself but remaining inferior to metallic handle interferences.

To bridge this gap, we present MathVista, a benchmark designed to combine challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. It consists of 6,141 examples, derived from 28 existing multimodal datasets involving mathematics and 3 newly created datasets (i.e., IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA). Completing these tasks requires fine-grained, deep visual understanding and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging. With MathVista, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of 12 prominent foundation models. The best-performing GPT-4V model achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9%, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best performer, by 15.1%. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the superiority of GPT-4V is mainly attributed to its enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning. However, GPT-4V still falls short of human performance by 10.4%, as it often struggles to understand complex figures and perform rigorous reasoning.

An Observation Strategy   for the Target Stars,1970,"  The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.

Magnetic insulator heterostructures bestow superior structural and magnetic properties and house immense design space thanks to the strong and engineerable exchange interaction between individual layers. To fully unleash their potential, realizing low damping and strong exchange coupling simultaneously is critical, which often requires high quality interface. Here, we show that such a demand is realized in an all-insulator thulium iron garnet (TmIG)/YIG bilayer system. The ultralow dissipation rates in both YIG and TmIG, along with their significant spin-spin interaction at the interface, enable strong and coherent magnon-magnon coupling with a benchmarking cooperativity value larger than the conventional ferromagnetic metal-based heterostructures. The coupling strength can be tuned by varying the magnetic insulator layer thickness and magnon modes, which is consistent with analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our results demonstrate TmIG/YIG as a novel platform for investigating hybrid magnonic phenomena and open opportunities in magnon devices comprising all-insulator heterostructures.

Here, we present evidence for the claim that LMs may show inverse scaling, or worse task performance with increased scale, e.g., due to flaws in the training objective and data. We present empirical evidence of inverse scaling on 11 datasets collected by running a public contest, the Inverse Scaling Prize, with a substantial prize pool. Through analysis of the datasets, along with other examples found in the literature, we identify four potential causes of inverse scaling: (i) preference to repeat memorized sequences over following in-context instructions, (ii) imitation of undesirable patterns in the training data, (iii) tasks containing an easy distractor task which LMs could focus on, rather than the harder real task, and (iv) correct but misleading few-shot demonstrations of the task. We release the winning datasets at https://inversescaling.com/data to allow for further investigation of inverse scaling. Our tasks have helped drive the discovery of U-shaped and inverted-U scaling trends, where an initial trend reverses, suggesting that scaling trends are less reliable at predicting the behavior of larger-scale models than previously understood. Overall, our results suggest that there are tasks for which increased model scale alone may not lead to progress, and that more careful thought needs to go into the data and objectives for training language models.

This research focuses on a detailed analysis of the magnetic behavior exhibited by NdZnPO, a bilayer spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet. The investigation employs magnetization, specific heat, and powder neutron scattering measurements. At zero field, a long-range magnetic order is observed at $T_{\rm N}=1.64~\rm K$. Powder neutron diffraction experiments show the Ising-like magnetic moments along the $c$-axis, revealing a stripe-like magnetic structure with three equivalent magnetic propagation vectors. Application of a magnetic field along the $c$-axis suppresses the antiferromagnetic order, leading to a fully polarized ferromagnetic state above $B_{\rm c}=4.5~\rm T$. This transition is accompanied by notable enhancements in the nuclear Schottky contribution. Moreover, the absence of spin frustration and expected field-induced plateau-like phases are remarkable observations. Detailed calculations of magnetic dipolar interactions revealed complex couplings reminiscent of a honeycomb lattice, suggesting the potential emergence of Kitaev-like physics within this system.

With the successful preparation of single crystals, we mapped out the magnetic phase diagrams under the $c$-axis and $ab$-plane directional magnetic fields $B$. For $B\|c$, the three-dimensional (3D) magnon Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is evidenced by the power law scaling of the transition temperature, $T_c\propto (B_c-B)^{2/3}$. For $B\|ab$, the transition from the canted antiferromagetic (CAFM) state to the fully polarized (FP) state is a crossover rather than phase transition, and the characteristic temperature has a significant deviation from the 3D BEC scaling. The different behaviors of the field-induced magnetic transitions for $B\|c$ and $B\|ab$ could result from the Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya (DM) interaction with the DM vector along the $c$-axis, which preserves the $c$-axis directional spin rotation symmetry and breaks the spin rotation symmetry when $B\|ab$. The 3D magnon BEC scaling for $B\|c$ is immune to the off-stoichiometric disorder in our sample $\alpha-Cu_{3.26}Mg_{0.74}(OH)_6Br_2$.

In this paper, we introduce combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature for discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces, which is a parameterized generalization of the classical combinatorial curvature. Then we prove the local and global rigidity of combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature with respect to discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces, which confirms parameterized Glickenstein rigidity conjecture. To study the Yamabe problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature, we introduce combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow for discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces, which is a generalization of Chow-Luo's combinatorial Ricci flow for Thurston's circle packings and Luo's combinatorial Yamabe flow for vertex scaling on polyhedral surfaces. To handle the potential singularities of the combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow, we extend the flow through the singularities by extending the inner angles in triangles by constants. Under the existence of a discrete conformal structure with prescribed combinatorial curvature, the solution of extended combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow is proved to exist for all time and converge exponentially fast for any initial value. This confirms a parameterized generalization of another conjecture of Glickenstein on the convergence of combinatorial Ricci flow, gives an almost equivalent characterization of the solvability of Yamabe problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature in terms of combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow and provides an effective algorithm for finding discrete conformal structures with prescribed combinatorial $\alpha$-curvatures.

Specifically, M$^2$-3DLaneNet lifts 2D features into 3D space by incorporating geometry information from LiDAR data through depth completion. Subsequently, the lifted 2D features are further enhanced with LiDAR features through cross-modality BEV fusion.

Critical to progress and safety, high-definition (HD) maps, a type of centimeter-level map collected using a laser sensor, provide accurate descriptions of the surrounding environment. The key challenge of HD map production is efficient, high-quality collection and annotation of large-volume datasets. Due to the demand for high quality, HD map production requires significant manual human effort to create annotations, a very time-consuming and costly process for the map industry. In order to reduce manual annotation burdens, many artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to pre-label the HD maps. However, there still exists a large gap between AI algorithms and the traditional manual HD map production pipelines in accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, it is also very resource-costly to build large-scale annotated datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms for AI-based HD map automatic labeling systems. In this paper, we introduce the Tencent HD Map AI (THMA) system, an innovative end-to-end, AI-based, active learning HD map labeling system capable of producing and labeling HD maps with a scale of hundreds of thousands of kilometers. In THMA, we train AI models directly from massive HD map datasets via supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning to achieve high accuracy and efficiency required by downstream users. THMA has been deployed by the Tencent Map team to provide services to downstream companies and users, serving over 1,000 labeling workers and producing more than 30,000 kilometers of HD map data per day at most. More than 90 percent of the HD map data in Tencent Map is labeled automatically by THMA, accelerating the traditional HD map labeling process by more than ten times.

0000-0003-4489-5304,Chao Zheng,The University of Hong Kong,Application of Deep Learning Methods for Distinguishing Gamma-Ray Bursts   from Fermi/GBM TTE Data,1970,"  To investigate GRBs in depth, it is crucial to develop an effective method for identifying GRBs accurately. Current criteria, e.g., onboard blind search, ground blind search, and target search, are limited by manually set thresholds and perhaps miss GRBs, especially for sub-threshold events. We propose a novel approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish GRBs and non-GRBs directly. We structured three CNN models, plain-CNN, ResNet, and ResNet-CBAM, and endeavored to exercise fusing strategy models. Count maps of NaI detectors onboard Fermi/GBM were employed as the input samples of datasets and models were implemented to evaluate their performance on different time scale data. The ResNet-CBAM model trained on 64 ms dataset achieves high accuracy overall, which includes residual and attention mechanism modules. The visualization methods of Grad-CAM and t-SNE explicitly displayed that the optimal model focuses on the key features of GRBs precisely. The model was applied to analyze one-year data, accurately identifying approximately 98% of GRBs listed in the Fermi burst catalog, 8 out of 9 sub-threshold GRBs, and 5 GRBs triggered by other satellites, which demonstrated the deep learning methods could effectively distinguish GRBs from observational data. Besides, thousands of unknown candidates were retrieved and compared with the bursts of SGR J1935+2154 for instance, which exemplified the potential scientific value of these candidates indeed. Detailed studies on integrating our model into real-time analysis pipelines thus may improve their accuracy of inspection, and provide valuable guidance for rapid follow-up observations of multi-band telescopes.

We propose a computational model of emotion that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and appraisal theory, establishing a formal relationship between reward processing, goal-directed task learning, cognitive appraisal and emotional experiences.

The formalization is task independent and can be applied to any task that can be represented as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and solved using RL.

However, the potential large random access (RA) delay calls for a new RA scheme and for a detailed assessment of its performance. Motivated by the key idea of non-orthogonal multiple access, the non-orthogonal random access (NORA) scheme based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) is proposed in this paper to alleviate the access congestion problem. Specifically, NORA utilizes the difference of time of arrival to identify multiple UEs with the identical preamble, and enables power domain multiplexing of collided UEs in the following access process, while the base station performs SIC based on the channel conditions obtained through preamble detection. Our analysis show that the performance of NORA is superior to the conventional orthogonal random access (ORA) scheme in terms of the preamble collision probability, access success probability and throughput of random access. Simulation results verify our analysis and further show that our NORA scheme can improve the number of the supported UEs by more than 30%. Moreover, the number of preamble transmissions and the access delay for successfully accessed UEs are also reduced significantly by using the proposed random access scheme.

In addition, asymptotic approximations are provided for the proposed H transform and MGF based approach as well as for the effective rate over i.n.i.d. MISO hyper Fox's H fading channels.

Therefore, it is critical to analyze the corresponding coverage probability of IRS-aided communication systems. To our best knowledge, however, previous works focusing on this issue are very limited. In this paper, we analyze the coverage probability under the Rayleigh fading channel, taking the number and size of the array elements into consideration. We first derive the exact closed-form of coverage probability for the unit element. Afterward, with the method of moment matching, the approximation of the coverage probability can be formulated as the ratio of upper incomplete Gamma function and Gamma function, allowing an arbitrary number of elements. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the impacts of essential factors on the coverage probability, such as the coefficient of fading channel, the number and size of the element, and the angle of incidence. Overall, the paper provides a succinct and general expression of coverage probability, which can be helpful in the performance evaluation and practical implementation of the IRS.

However, neither UDN nor mMIMO will meet the increasing data rate demands of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications due to the inter-cell interference and large quality-of-service variations, respectively. Cell-free (CF) mMIMO, which combines the best aspects of UDN and mMIMO, is viewed as a key solution to this issue. In such systems, each user equipment (UE) is served by a preferred set of surrounding APs cooperatively. In this paper, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art literature on CF mMIMO.

However, the great Doppler frequency offset (DFO) leads to serious inter-carrier interference in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, which makes it difficult to provide high-quality transmissions for both high-speed train (HST) operation control systems and passengers. In this paper, we focus on the performance of CF massive MIMO-OFDM systems with both fully centralized and local minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining in HST communications. Considering the local maximum ratio (MR) combining, the large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) cooperation and the practical effect of DFO on system performance, exact closed-form expressions for uplink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions are derived. We observe that cooperative MMSE combining achieves better SE performance than uncooperative MR combining. In addition, HST communications with small cell and cellular massive MIMO-OFDM systems are compared in terms of SE. Numerical results reveal that the CF massive MIMO-OFDM system achieves a larger and more uniform SE than the other systems. Finally, the train antenna centric (TA-centric) CF massive MIMO-OFDM system is designed for practical implementation in HST communications, and three power control schemes are adopted to optimize the propagation of TAs for reducing the impact of the DFO.

In conventional massive MIMO, the channel is often modeled by the far-field planar-wavefront with rich sparsity in the angular domain that facilitates the design of low-complexity channel estimation. However, this sparsity is not conspicuous in XL-MIMO systems due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront. To address the inherent performance loss of the angular-domain channel estimation schemes, we first propose the polar-domain multiple residual dense network (P-MRDN) for XL-MIMO systems based on the polar-domain sparsity of the near-field channel by improving the existing MRDN scheme. Furthermore, a polar-domain multi-scale residual dense network (P-MSRDN) is designed to improve the channel estimation accuracy.

This is due to the fact that the positions of antennas at the transceiver and reflector can be dynamically optimized to achieve better channel conditions and, as such, can provide high spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) gains with fewer antennas. In this article, we introduce the fundamentals of FLP-MIMO systems, including hardware design, structure design, and potential applications. We shall demonstrate that FLP-MIMO, using fewer flexible antennas, can match the channel hardening achieved by a large number of fixed antennas. We will then analyze the SE-EE relationship for FLP-MIMO and fixed-position MIMO. Furthermore, we will design the optimal trajectory of flexible antennas to maximize system sum SE or total EE at a fixed travel distance of each antenna. Finally, several important research directions regarding FLP-MIMO communications are presented to facilitate further investigation.

Leveraging its structure for direct EM signal processing alongside its low-power consumption, SIM holds promise for enhancing system performance within wireless communication systems. In this paper, we focus on SIM-assisted multi-user multi-input and single-output (MU-MISO) system downlink scenarios in the transmitter. We proposed a joint optimization method for SIM phase shift configuration and antenna power allocation based on the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to efficiently improve the sum rate. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and alternating optimization (AO) algorithms. Furthermore, increasing the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM is always beneficial.

However, the computational overheads in jointly training semantic encoders and decoders-and the subsequent deployment in network devices-are overlooked. Recent advances in Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offer a potential solution. The robust learning abilities of GAI models indicate that semantic decoders can reconstruct source messages using a limited amount of semantic information, e.g., prompts, without joint training with the semantic encoder. A notable challenge, however, is the instability introduced by GAI's diverse generation ability. This instability, evident in outputs like text-generated images, limits the direct application of GAI in scenarios demanding accurate message recovery, such as face image transmission. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a GAI-aided SemCom system with multi-model prompts for accurate content decoding. Moreover, in response to security concerns, we introduce the application of covert communications aided by a friendly jammer. The system jointly optimizes the diffusion step, jamming, and transmitting power with the aid of the generative diffusion models, enabling successful and secure transmission of the source messages.

However, traditional adaptive filter-based approaches may suffer from individual variations in EEG signals, while deep neural network-based approaches may be hindered by the non-stationarity of EEG signals caused by biomarker attenuation and background oscillations. To address these challenges, we propose the Visual Evoked Potential Booster (VEP Booster), a novel closed-loop AI framework that generates reliable and stable EEG biomarkers under visual stimulation protocols. Our system leverages an image generator to refine stimulus images based on real-time feedback from human EEG signals, generating visual stimuli tailored to the preferences of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons and enabling effective targeting of neurons most responsive to stimuli. We validated our approach by implementing a system and employing steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) visual protocols in five human subjects.

0000-0001-9416-1523,Jiayi Zhang,Tsinghua University,Learning Audio-Visual Source Localization via False Negative Aware   Contrastive Learning,1970,"  Self-supervised audio-visual source localization aims to locate sound-source objects in video frames without extra annotations. Recent methods often approach this goal with the help of contrastive learning, which assumes only the audio and visual contents from the same video are positive samples for each other. However, this assumption would suffer from false negative samples in real-world training. For example, for an audio sample, treating the frames from the same audio class as negative samples may mislead the model and therefore harm the learned representations e.g., the audio of a siren wailing may reasonably correspond to the ambulances in multiple images). Based on this observation, we propose a new learning strategy named False Negative Aware Contrastive (FNAC) to mitigate the problem of misleading the training with such false negative samples. Specifically, we utilize the intra-modal similarities to identify potentially similar samples and construct corresponding adjacency matrices to guide contrastive learning. Further, we propose to strengthen the role of true negative samples by explicitly leveraging the visual features of sound sources to facilitate the differentiation of authentic sounding source regions. FNAC achieves state-of-the-art performances on Flickr-SoundNet, VGG-Sound, and AVSBench, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the false negative issue.

However, this task can be quite challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space as the system size increases. Many standard methods have significant weaknesses. For instance, message-passing algorithms can be inaccurate and even fail to converge due to short loops. At the same time, tensor network methods can have exponential computational complexity in large graphs due to long loops. This work proposes a new method called ``tensor network message passing.'' This approach allows us to compute local observables like marginal probabilities and correlations by combining the strengths of tensor networks in contracting small sub-graphs with many short loops and the strengths of message-passing methods in globally sparse graphs, thus addressing the crucial weaknesses of both approaches. Our algorithm is exact for systems that are globally tree-like and locally dense-connected when the dense local graphs have limited treewidth. We have conducted numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs to compute magnetizations of Ising models and spin glasses, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over standard belief propagation and the recently proposed loopy message-passing algorithm.

The primary simulation methods are based on state vectors and tensor networks. As the number of qubits and quantum gates grows larger in current quantum devices, traditional state-vector based quantum circuit simulation methods prove inadequate due to the overwhelming size of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement. Consequently, brutal force tensor network simulation algorithms become the only viable solution in such scenarios. The two main challenges faced in tensor network simulation algorithms are optimal contraction path finding and efficient execution on modern computing devices, with the latter determines the actual efficiency. In this study, we investigate the optimization of such tensor network simulations on modern GPUs and propose general optimization strategies from two aspects: computational efficiency and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to transform critical Einstein summation operations into GEMM operations, leveraging the specific features of tensor network simulations to amplify the efficiency of GPUs. Secondly, by analyzing the data characteristics of quantum circuits, we employ extended precision to ensure the accuracy of simulation results and mixed precision to fully exploit the potential of GPUs, resulting in faster and more precise simulations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 3.96x reduction in verification time for random quantum circuit samples in the 18-cycle case of Sycamore, with sustained performance exceeding 21 TFLOPS on one A100. This method can be easily extended to the 20-cycle case, maintaining the same performance, accelerating by 12.5x compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based results and 4.48-6.78x compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based results reported in the literature.

In recent years, many interests have been attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have the advantages of a principle understanding of the expressive power using entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting classical computation and quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing tensor network models for unsupervised machine learning only work as a proof of principle, as their performance is much worse than the standard models such as restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this Letter, we present autoregressive matrix product states (AMPS), a tensor network model combining matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and autoregressive modeling from machine learning. Our model enjoys the exact calculation of normalized probability and unbiased sampling. We demonstrate the performance of our model using two applications, generative modeling on synthetic and real-world data, and reinforcement learning in statistical physics.

It inherits challenges of equilibrium, including accurately describing the joint distribution of a large number of configurations, and also poses new challenges as the distribution evolves over time. Characterizing dynamical phase transitions as an emergent behavior further requires tracking nonequilibrium systems under a control parameter. While a number of methods have been proposed, such as tensor networks for one-dimensional lattices, we lack a method for arbitrary time beyond the steady state and for higher dimensions. Here, we develop a general computational framework to study the time evolution of nonequilibrium systems in statistical mechanics by leveraging variational autoregressive networks, which offer an efficient computation on the dynamical partition function, a central quantity for discovering the phase transition. We apply the approach to prototype models of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, including the kinetically constrained models of structural glasses up to three dimensions. The approach uncovers the active-inactive phase transition of spin flips, the dynamical phase diagram, as well as new scaling relations. The result highlights the potential of machine learning dynamical phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems.

Using extensive numerical experiments we show that SSD greatly outperforms L1-norm based methods, Orthogonal Least Squares, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and Approximate Message Passing when the sampling matrix contains strong correlations. This nice property of correlation tolerance makes SSD a versatile and robust tool for different types of real-world signal acquisition tasks.

However, in order to achieve exact contraction, only tree-like tensor networks such as the matrix product states and tree tensor networks have been considered, even for modeling two-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we construct supervised learning models for images using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network having a similar structure prior to natural images. Our approach first performs a feature map, which transforms the image data to a product state on a grid, then contracts the product state to a PEPS with trainable parameters to predict image labels. The tensor elements of PEPS are trained by minimizing differences between training labels and predicted labels. The proposed model is evaluated on image classifications using the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that our model is significantly superior to existing models using tree-like tensor networks.

We validate our method using the frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and compare its performance to the case without symmetrization.

Herein, a global neural network potential (GNNP) is developed to provide direct theoretical understandings by performing long-time and large-size atomic simulations. We propose a self-consistent picture as follows: (i) CoO$_2$ layers are easier to glide with longer distances at more highly delithiated states, resulting in structural transitions and structural inhomogeneity; (ii) at regions between different phases with different Li distributions due to gliding, local strains are induced and accumulate during cycling processes; (3) accumulated strains cause the rupture of Li diffusion channels and result in formation of oxygen dimers during cycling especially when Li has inhomogeneous distributions, leading to capacity degradations and safety issues. We find that large tensile strains combined with inhomogeneous distributions of Li ions play critical roles in the formation processes of blocked Li diffusion channels and the oxygen dimers at high-delithiation states, which could be the fundamental origins of capacity degradations and safety issues. Correspondingly, suppressing accumulations of strains by controlling charge and discharge conditions as well as suppressing the gliding will be helpful for improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

As these systems are widely utilized, ensuring their reliable operation is becoming a design requirement. Traditional error detection mechanisms introduce circuit or time redundancy that significantly impacts system performance. An alternative is the use of Concurrent Error Detection (CED) schemes that operate in parallel with the system and exploit their properties to detect errors. CED is attractive for large ML systems because it can potentially reduce the cost of error detection. In this paper, we introduce Concurrent Classifier Error Detection (CCED), a scheme to implement CED in ML systems using a concurrent ML classifier to detect errors. CCED identifies a set of check signals in the main ML system and feeds them to the concurrent ML classifier that is trained to detect errors. The proposed CCED scheme has been implemented and evaluated on two widely used large-scale ML models: Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) used for image classification and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) used for natural language applications. The results show that more than 95 percent of the errors are detected when using a simple Random Forest classifier that is order of magnitude simpler than CLIP or BERT.

We study the unusual renormalizations of the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and gap velocity $v_{\Delta}$ of these quasiparticles close to various quantum critical points in a superconducting dome. Special attention is paid to the behavior of the velocity ratio, $v_{\Delta}/v_F$, since it determines a number of observable quantities. We perform a renormalization-group analysis and show that the velocity ratio may vanish, approach unity, or diverge at different quantum critical points. The corresponding superfluid densities and critical temperatures are suppressed, slightly increased, or significantly enhanced. The effects of three types of static disorders, namely, random mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, on the stability of the system are also addressed. An analogous analysis reveals that both random mass and random gauge potential are irrelevant. This implies that these fixed points of the velocity ratio are stable, and hence observable effects ignited by them are unchanged. However, the random chemical potential is marginal. As a result, these fixed points are broken, and thus, the instabilities of quantum phase transitions are triggered.

It is therefore necessary to examine whether a specific disorder is relevant or not. We study the interplay between critical nematic fluctuation and random chemical potential by performing renormalization group analysis. The parameter that characterizes the strength of random chemical potential is marginal at the one-loop level, but becomes marginally relevant after including the two-loop corrections. Thus even weak random chemical potential leads to diffusive motion of nodal fermions and the significantly critical behaviors of physical implications, since the strength flows eventually to large values at low energies.

We neglect the extended scales of two star components and treat them as heavy point particles, which gravitationally interact with each other via the exchanges of both gravitons and scalar particles, because of the settled scalar configurations inside the stars. Accordingly, the gravitational potential includes both Newtonian potential and scalar-modified Newtonian-like part. We, in the non-relativistic limit, calculate the non-analytic corrections to the modified gravitational potential directly from the sum of all exchanges of both gravitons and scalar particles to one-loop order. The appropriate vertex rules are extracted from the effective Lagrangian. Our calculations demonstrate that either the graviton exchanges or the exchanges of scalar particles contribute to both classical relativistic corrections and quantum corrections to the gravitational potential of the scalarized NS binaries.

Because of the difference in binding energy of NS and WD, the orbital decay of scalarized NS-WD system actually sources an emission of dipolar gravitational scalar radiation, in addition to the tensor gravitational waves, which breaks the Lorentz invariance constructed in the framework of general relativity. The resulted gravitational scalar radiation field obtains a scalar-energy-density-dependent effective mass, arising from a gravitational scalar potential that consists of a monotonically decreasing self-interactions of gravitational scalar field and an increasing exponential coupling between the scalar field and the NS/WD matter. Owing to a thin-ring-orbit effect, the gravitational interactions encoded by the massive scalar field is screened in the region of binary orbit, with high density of stars' scalar energy, which gives us the estimation for scalar masses of about $10^{-21} eV/c^2$ and leads to a Yulkawa-like correction to the Newtonian potential of the binary system. We demonstrate that the radiated gravitational tensor waves, propagating in the Yukawa type of potential, gain a scalar-background-dependent mass term of the order of $\sim 10^{-23} eV/c^2$.

Because of the appearance of a gravitational scalar background field, with small fluctuations, converged by iterative interplay of the mass dimensional external scalar fields, the binary system suffers from a spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The two scalarized NSs dip in a Higgs-like gravitational scalar potential, where the massless scalar background fluctuation field plays the role of Higgs field. Consequently, the gravitational scalar background field becomes massive. The radiated gravitons, propagating in a Yukawa-corrected potential, acquire a scalar-background-dependent mass term, in a massive-scalar-field-mediated way. We demonstrate that the mass of gravitons depends on intrinsic properties of the sources, which is not a certain value. The background-dependent masses for gravitons from scalarized orbital shrinking DNS is variable with the compactness of two components, as well as the separation of the binary. We get the effective masses for gravitons radiated from 8 detected DNS binaries with more precise mass measurements in our galaxy, whose values appear to be of the order of $10^{-23} ev/c^2$.

Consequently, the exterior space-time is changed, and an external scalar field appears, which subsequently triggers a scalarization of its companion. The dynamical interplay produces a gravitational scalar counterpart of tensor gravitational waves. In this paper, we resort to scalar-tensor theory and demonstrate that the gravitational scalar counterpart from double neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) become massive.

Based on Dewitt's approach, we calculate the gravitational Casimir energy cost of the binary plane, which consists of statically gravitational effects and deformation-induced effects. It is found that the static effects include a term coming from the self-gravity of the orbital plane and the contribution of Newtonian gravitational potential of the binary system. While the deformation-induced effect also results from two parts, i.e. the instability of orbital binding energy, scaling as $\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}$, and the dynamically Casimir energy cost of the orbital binding energy, decaying as $\frac{1}{(R-r)^4}$. The dynamically gravitational Casimir phenomena and the corresponding energy cost modify the spiral-in orbital motion of the binary and thus the frequency of released gravitational waves (GWs). We consider the mechanical response of two NS components and qualitatively study the corrections to the orbital motion of the system and the GW frequencies. It is found that the dynamical Casimir effects exert a dissipative force on the binary plane, depending on the frequency of GWs. The resultant dissipation may enhance with the decaying separation and increasing GW frequencies, which subsequently accelerates the orbital decay of the binary. However, the dissipation rate just has an order of $10^{-70}$ eV/s. So the corrections to the dynamics of NS binaries are very marginal, by considering the wide separation, the cosmological coalescence time, and low-frequency GWs of the system.

This paper presents a basic machine learning algorithm, named Dendrite Net or DD, just like Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). DD's main concept is that the algorithm can recognize this class after learning, if the output's logical expression contains the corresponding class's logical relationship among inputs (and$\backslash$or$\backslash$not). Experiments and main results: DD, a white-box machine learning algorithm, showed excellent system identification performance for the black-box system. Secondly, it was verified by nine real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability relative to MLP architecture that imitated neurons' cell body (Cell body Net) for regression. Thirdly, by MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets, it was verified that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than Cell body Net for classification. The number of modules can effectively adjust DD's logical expression capacity, which avoids over-fitting and makes it easy to get a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated experiments in MATLAB and PyTorch (Python) demonstrated that DD was faster than Cell body Net both in epoch and forward-propagation. The main contribution of this paper is the basic machine learning algorithm (DD) with a white-box attribute, controllable precision for better generalization capability, and lower computational complexity.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a versatile tool for image segmentation without specific domain training, but it requires human prompts and may have limitations in specific domains. Traditional models like nnUNet perform automatic segmentation during inference and are effective in specific domains but need extensive domain-specific training. To combine the strengths of foundational and domain-specific models, we propose nnSAM, integrating SAM's robust feature extraction with nnUNet's automatic configuration to enhance segmentation accuracy on small datasets. Our nnSAM model optimizes two main approaches: leveraging SAM's feature extraction and nnUNet's domain-specific adaptation, and incorporating a boundary shape supervision loss function based on level set functions and curvature calculations to learn anatomical shape priors from limited data. We evaluated nnSAM on four segmentation tasks: brain white matter, liver, lung, and heart segmentation. Our method outperformed others, achieving the highest DICE score of 82.77% and the lowest ASD of 1.14 mm in brain white matter segmentation with 20 training samples, compared to nnUNet's DICE score of 79.25% and ASD of 1.36 mm. A sample size study highlighted nnSAM's advantage with fewer training samples. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance with nnSAM, showcasing its potential for small-sample learning in medical image segmentation.

Here we present band engineering in the twisted orbital-active bilayers with spin-orbit coupling. The symmetry constraints on the interlayer coupling that determines the effective potential for low-energy physics of moir\'e electrons are exhaustively derived for two-dimensional point groups. We find the line graph or biparticle sublattice of moir\'e pattern emerge with a minimal $C_3$ symmetry, which exhibit isolated electronic flat bands with nontrivial topology. The band flatness is insensitive to the twist angle since they come from the interference effect. Armed with this guiding principle, we predict that twisted bilayers of 2H-PbS$_2$ and CdS realize the salient physics to engineer two-dimensional topological quantum phases. At small twist angles, PbS$_2$ heterostructures give rise to an emergent moir\'e Kagom\'e lattice, while CdS heterostructures lead to an emergent moir\'e honeycomb lattice, and both of them host moir\'e quantum spin Hall insulators with almost flat topological bands. We further study superconductivity of these two systems with local attractive interactions. The superfluid weight and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are determined by multiband processes and quantum geometry of the band in the flat-band limit when the pairing potential exceeds the band width.

In order to determine a small set of proposals with a high recall, a common scheme is extracting multiple features followed by a ranking algorithm which however, incurs two major challenges: {\bf 1)} The ranking model often imposes pairwise constraints between each proposal, rendering the problem away from an efficient training/testing phase; {\bf 2)} Linear kernels are utilized due to the computational and memory bottleneck of training a kernelized model.   In this paper, we remedy these two issues by suggesting a {\em kernelized partial ranking model}. In particular, we demonstrate that {\bf i)} our partial ranking model reduces the number of constraints from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nk)$ where $n$ is the number of all potential proposals for an image but we are only interested in top-$k$ of them that has the largest overlap with the ground truth; {\bf ii)} we permit non-linear kernels in our model which is often superior to the linear classifier in terms of accuracy. For the sake of mitigating the computational and memory issues, we introduce a consistent weighted sampling~(CWS) paradigm that approximates the non-linear kernel as well as facilitates an efficient learning. In fact, as we will show, training a linear CWS model amounts to learning a kernelized model.

With the help of the renormalization group approach, we can treat all kinds of fermionic interactions on the the same footing and then establish the coupled energy-dependent flows of fermionic interaction parameters via collecting one-loop corrections, from which a number of interesting results are extracted in the low-energy regime. At first, various sorts of fermion-fermion interactions furiously compete with each other and are inevitably attracted by certain fixed point in the parameter space, which clusters into three qualitatively distinct regions relying heavily upon the structure parameters of materials. In addition, we notice that an instability accompanied by some symmetry breaking is triggered around different sorts of fixed points. Computing and comparing susceptibilities of twelve potential candidates indicates that charge density wave always dominates over all other instabilities.

0000-0002-6394-5357,Jing Wang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang university",Physics-Assisted Reduced-Order Modeling for Identifying Dominant   Features of Transonic Buffet,1970,"  Transonic buffet is a flow instability phenomenon that arises from the interaction between the shock wave and the separated boundary layer. This flow phenomenon is considered to be highly detrimental during flight and poses a significant risk to the structural strength and fatigue life of aircraft. Up to now, there has been a lack of an accurate, efficient, and intuitive metric to predict buffet and impose a feasible constraint on aerodynamic design. In this paper, a Physics-Assisted Variational Autoencoder (PAVAE) is proposed to identify dominant features of transonic buffet, which combines unsupervised reduced-order modeling with additional physical information embedded via a buffet classifier. Specifically, four models with various weights adjusting the contribution of the classifier are trained, so as to investigate the impact of buffet information on the latent space. Statistical results reveal that buffet state can be determined exactly with just one latent space when a proper weight of classifier is chosen. The dominant latent space further reveals a strong relevance with the key flow features located in the boundary layers downstream of shock. Based on this identification, the displacement thickness at 80% chordwise location is proposed as a metric for buffet prediction. This metric achieves an accuracy of 98.5% in buffet state classification, which is more reliable than the existing separation metric used in design. The proposed method integrates the benefits of feature extraction, flow reconstruction, and buffet prediction into a unified framework, demonstrating its potential in low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data and interpreting the ""black box"" neural network.

Employing the renormalization group that unbiasedly treats all kinds of potential degrees of freedom, we establish energy-dependent coupled flows for all associated interaction parameters. Decoding the low-energy information from these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of nodal-line superconductors.

We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With the help of the detailed numerical analysis, we notice that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct kinds of fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$ and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. Such fixed points principally dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime, which are always associated with some instabilities with specific symmetry breakings and thus accompanied by certain phase transitions. In order to judge the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we bring out a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, it is determined that the dominant states correspond to a spin-singlet superconductivity, a spin-triplet pair-density-wave, and a spin-triplet superconductivity for approaching the fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively.

The parameters exhibit flavor universality which is dictated by the gauge interactions and which efficiently eliminates new dangerous contributions to flavor changing neutral currents. However, the Higgs potential in this framework typically contains an unacceptable hierarchy between its dimensionful parameters (the $\mu$-problem of gauge mediation). We show that the problem can be resolved if the Higgs potential arises dynamically once an intermediate U(1)' sector is integrated out rather than arising radiatively from some Yukawa interactions at the messenger scale. As an added benefit, such models may naturally avoid new contribution to CP violating amplitudes. The proposed framework is described, explicit examples are given and its phenomenology is explored.

We study the disorder effect on the nematic quantum critical behavior and especially on the flow of fermion velocities. The disorders that couple to nodal quasiparticles are divided into three types: random mass, random gauge field, and random chemical potential. A renormalization group analysis shows that random mass and random gauge field are both irrelevant and thus do not change the fixed point of extreme velocity anisotropy.

Low frequency optical absorption due to the surface state is universally determined by the fine structure constant. When the thickness of these three dimensional topological insulators is reduced, they become quasi-two dimensional insulators with enhanced absorbance. The two dimensional insulators can be topologically trivial or non-trivial depending on the thickness, and we predict that the optical absorption is larger for topological non-trivial case compared with the trivial case. Since the three dimensional topological insulator surface state is intrinsically gapless, we propose its potential application in wide bandwidth, high performance photo-detection covering a broad spectrum ranging from terahertz to infrared. The performance of photodetection can be dramatically enhanced when the thickness is reduced to several quintuple layers, with a widely tunable band gap depending on the thickness.

There is no fermion velocity renormalization since the system respects Lorentz invariance. At finite chemical potential, the Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken by the finite Fermi surface. The longitudinal gauge interaction is statically screened and becomes unimportant, whereas the transverse gauge interaction remains long-ranged and leads to singular renormalization of fermion velocity. The anomalous dimension of fermion velocity is calculated by means of the renormalization group method.

In this paper, we numerically demonstrate that, for real symmetric random matrices with non-positive off-diagonal elements, a universal scaling between the eigenvector and matrix elements exists. Namely, each element of the eigenvector of ground states linearly correlates with the sum of matrix elements in the corresponding row. Although the conclusion is obtained based on the random matrices, the linear relationship still keeps for regular matrices, in which off-diagonal elements are non-positive. The relationship implies a straightforward method to directly calculate the eigenvector of ground states for a kind of matrices.

To increase the energy efficiency, here we show an integrated photonic architecture specifically for convolutional layer calculations. Optical delay lines replace electronics to execute data manipulations on optical chip, reducing the scale of electro-optic modulation array. Consequently, the energy dissipation of these parts is mitigated. Powered by wavelength division multiplexing, the footprint of delay lines is significantly reduced compared with previous art, thus being practical to fabricate. We evaluate the potential performance of the proposed architecture with respect to component flaws in practical fabrications. According to the results, with well-controlled system insertion loss, energy efficiency of the proposed architecture would surpass previously presented works and the state-of-art electronic processors.

With the application of renormalization group, several interesting low-energy behaviors are extracted from the coupled equations of all interaction parameters. At the clean limit, fermion-fermion interactions decrease with lowering the energy scales but conversely fermion velocities climb up and approach certain saturated values. This yields a slight decrease or increase of the anisotropy of fermion velocities depending upon their initial ratio. After bringing out four kinds of disorders designated by the random charge ($\Delta_{1}$), random mass ($\Delta_{2}$), random axial chemical potential ($\Delta_{3}$), and spin-orbit scatterers ($\Delta_{4}$) based on their own unique features, we begin with presenting the distinct low-energy fates of these disorders. For the presence of sole disorder, its strength becomes either relevant ($\Delta_{1,4}$) or irrelevant($\Delta_{2,3}$) in the low-energy regime. However, the competition for multiple sorts of disorders is capable of qualitatively reshaping the low-energy properties of disorders $\Delta_{2,3,4}$. Besides, it can generate an initially absent disorder as long as two of $\Delta_{1,2,3}$ are present. In addition, the fermion-fermion couplings are insensitive to the presence of $\Delta_4$ but rather substantially modified by $\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$, or $\Delta_3$, and evolve towards zero or certain finite non-zero values under the coexistence of distinct disorders. Furthermore, the fermion velocities flow towards certain finite saturated value for the only presence of $\Delta_{2,3}$ and vanish for all other situations.

This enables us to have a full profile of solutions of the classical and nonlocal Fokas-Lenells equations. Some obtained solutions are illustrated based on asymptotic analysis.

This paper introduces a strategic approach to utilize in-context learning specifically for machine translation, aiming to significantly boost accuracy. The crux of this method lies in the judicious selection of demonstrations that are most effective for in-context learning. By selecting these examples carefully, GPT-4 can utilize them to achieve remarkably accurate machine translations, eliminating the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This technique is anchored in the semantic similarities between the user's prompt and the chosen dataset. Sentences from this dataset, carefully picked for their relevance and clarity, serve as potent demonstrations for in-context learning. This approach not only enhances translation accuracy but also enriches the understanding of nuanced linguistic structures. It represents a significant step forward in machine learning, leveraging the inherent capabilities of GPT-4 to provide translations that are not only accurate but also contextually rich and linguistically sophisticated. This method demonstrates the potential of in-context learning in overcoming language barriers, opening new avenues for cross-cultural communication and global collaboration.

However, the shallow connections between consecutive hidden states of RNNs and insufficient modeling of global information restrict the potential performance of those models. In this paper, we try to address these issues, and thus propose a Global Context enhanced Deep Transition architecture for sequence labeling named GCDT. We deepen the state transition path at each position in a sentence, and further assign every token with a global representation learned from the entire sentence. Experiments on two standard sequence labeling tasks show that, given only training data and the ubiquitous word embeddings (Glove), our GCDT achieves 91.96 F1 on the CoNLL03 NER task and 95.43 F1 on the CoNLL2000 Chunking task, which outperforms the best reported results under the same settings. Furthermore, by leveraging BERT as an additional resource, we establish new state-of-the-art results with 93.47 F1 on NER and 97.30 F1 on Chunking.

However, the difficulty of obtaining such templates actually hinders the practical application of SPG models. For one thing, the prohibitive cost makes it unfeasible to manually design decent templates for every source sentence. For another, the templates automatically retrieved by current heuristic methods are usually unreliable for SPG models to generate qualified paraphrases. To escape this dilemma, we propose a novel Quality-based Syntactic Template Retriever (QSTR) to retrieve templates based on the quality of the to-be-generated paraphrases. Furthermore, for situations requiring multiple paraphrases for each source sentence, we design a Diverse Templates Search (DTS) algorithm, which can enhance the diversity between paraphrases without sacrificing quality. Experiments demonstrate that QSTR can significantly surpass existing retrieval methods in generating high-quality paraphrases and even perform comparably with human-annotated templates in terms of reference-free metrics. Additionally, human evaluation and the performance on downstream tasks using our generated paraphrases for data augmentation showcase the potential of our QSTR and DTS algorithm in practical scenarios.

However, most existing models fail to fully utilize co-occurrence relations between slots and intents, which restricts their potential performance. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel Collaborative Memory Network (CM-Net) based on the well-designed block, named CM-block. The CM-block firstly captures slot-specific and intent-specific features from memories in a collaborative manner, and then uses these enriched features to enhance local context representations, based on which the sequential information flow leads to more specific (slot and intent) global utterance representations. Through stacking multiple CM-blocks, our CM-Net is able to alternately perform information exchange among specific memories, local contexts and the global utterance, and thus incrementally enriches each other. We evaluate the CM-Net on two standard benchmarks (ATIS and SNIPS) and a self-collected corpus (CAIS). Experimental results show that the CM-Net achieves the state-of-the-art results on the ATIS and SNIPS in most of criteria, and significantly outperforms the baseline models on the CAIS.

0000-0002-3264-8202,Yufeng Chen,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Confidence-Aware Scheduled Sampling for Neural Machine Translation,1970,"  Scheduled sampling is an effective method to alleviate the exposure bias problem of neural machine translation. It simulates the inference scene by randomly replacing ground-truth target input tokens with predicted ones during training. Despite its success, its critical schedule strategies are merely based on training steps, ignoring the real-time model competence, which limits its potential performance and convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose confidence-aware scheduled sampling. Specifically, we quantify real-time model competence by the confidence of model predictions, based on which we design fine-grained schedule strategies. In this way, the model is exactly exposed to predicted tokens for high-confidence positions and still ground-truth tokens for low-confidence positions. Moreover, we observe vanilla scheduled sampling suffers from degenerating into the original teacher forcing mode since most predicted tokens are the same as ground-truth tokens. Therefore, under the above confidence-aware strategy, we further expose more noisy tokens (e.g., wordy and incorrect word order) instead of predicted ones for high-confidence token positions. We evaluate our approach on the Transformer and conduct experiments on large-scale WMT 2014 English-German, WMT 2014 English-French, and WMT 2019 Chinese-English. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms the Transformer and vanilla scheduled sampling on both translation quality and convergence speed.

Although the conversation in its natural form is usually multimodal, there still lacks work on multimodal machine translation in conversations. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Chat Translation (MCT), aiming to generate more accurate translations with the help of the associated dialogue history and visual context. To this end, we firstly construct a Multimodal Sentiment Chat Translation Dataset (MSCTD) containing 142,871 English-Chinese utterance pairs in 14,762 bilingual dialogues and 30,370 English-German utterance pairs in 3,079 bilingual dialogues. Each utterance pair, corresponding to the visual context that reflects the current conversational scene, is annotated with a sentiment label. Then, we benchmark the task by establishing multiple baseline systems that incorporate multimodal and sentiment features for MCT. Preliminary experiments on four language directions (English-Chinese and English-German) verify the potential of contextual and multimodal information fusion and the positive impact of sentiment on the MCT task. Additionally, as a by-product of the MSCTD, it also provides two new benchmarks on multimodal dialogue sentiment analysis.

0000-0002-3264-8202,Yufeng Chen,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Unified Model Learning for Various Neural Machine Translation,1970,"  Existing neural machine translation (NMT) studies mainly focus on developing dataset-specific models based on data from different tasks (e.g., document translation and chat translation). Although the dataset-specific models have achieved impressive performance, it is cumbersome as each dataset demands a model to be designed, trained, and stored. In this work, we aim to unify these translation tasks into a more general setting. Specifically, we propose a ``versatile'' model, i.e., the Unified Model Learning for NMT (UMLNMT) that works with data from different tasks, and can translate well in multiple settings simultaneously, and theoretically it can be as many as possible. Through unified learning, UMLNMT is able to jointly train across multiple tasks, implementing intelligent on-demand translation. On seven widely-used translation tasks, including sentence translation, document translation, and chat translation, our UMLNMT results in substantial improvements over dataset-specific models with significantly reduced model deployment costs. Furthermore, UMLNMT can achieve competitive or better performance than state-of-the-art dataset-specific methods. Human evaluation and in-depth analysis also demonstrate the superiority of our approach on generating diverse and high-quality translations.

However, a potential pitfall for this approach is that we cannot decide whether the generated examples are adversarial to the target NMT model or the auxiliary backward one, as the reconstruction error through the RTT can be related to either. To remedy this problem, we propose a new criterion for NMT adversarial examples based on the Doubly Round-Trip Translation (DRTT). Specifically, apart from the source-target-source RTT, we also consider the target-source-target one, which is utilized to pick out the authentic adversarial examples for the target NMT model. Additionally, to enhance the robustness of the NMT model, we introduce the masked language models to construct bilingual adversarial pairs based on DRTT, which are used to train the NMT model directly. Extensive experiments on both the clean and noisy test sets (including the artificial and natural noise) show that our approach substantially improves the robustness of NMT models.

In the past decades, fiber-based TF synchronization techniques have been extensively studied. Instruments based on these techniques have been successfully applied. With the increasing application of TF synchronization instruments, their security has become an important issue. Unfortunately, the security risks of fiber-based frequency synchronization (FbFS) instruments have been overlooked. This paper proposes a frequency tampering method called ""frequency lens"". On a 200 km fiber link, we demonstrate a frequency tampering scenario using a frequency lens-enabled frequency tampering module (FTM). On the user side, the frequency value of the recovered 100 MHz signal can be stealthily altered within a range of 100 MHz-100 Hz to 100 MHz+100 Hz, while the frequency dissemination stability of the system remains normal. Related to this tampering risk, potential hazards in three different application scenarios, which rely on precise frequency references, are analyzed. Two countermeasures are also proposed to solve this tampering risk. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0D057F60>,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-3264-8202,Yufeng Chen,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Towards Understanding and Improving Knowledge Distillation for Neural   Machine Translation,1970,"  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising technique for model compression in neural machine translation. However, where the knowledge hides in KD is still not clear, which may hinder the development of KD. In this work, we first unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly, the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1 information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To address these issues, we propose a novel method named \textbf{T}op-1 \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation (TIE-KD). Specifically, we design a hierarchical ranking loss to enforce the learning of the top-1 information from the teacher. Additionally, we develop an iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the data without ground-truth targets. Experiments on WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 English-Romanian demonstrate that our method can respectively boost Transformer$_{base}$ students by +1.04, +0.60 and +1.11 BLEU scores and significantly outperform the vanilla word-level KD baseline. Besides, our method shows higher generalizability on different teacher-student capacity gaps than existing KD techniques.

This task is of great clinical significance but extremely challenging due to bleeding, lighting reflection, and motion blur in the complicated surgical environment. Compared with existing solutions, which either neglect geometric relationships among targeting objects or capture the relationships by using complicated aggregation schemes, the proposed network is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy while maintaining real-time performance by taking full advantage of the spatial relations among landmarks. We first devise an algorithm to automatically generate relation keypoint heatmaps, which are able to intuitively represent the prior knowledge of spatial relations among landmarks without using any extra manual annotation efforts. We then develop two complementary regularization schemes to progressively incorporate the prior knowledge into the training process. While one scheme introduces pixel-level regularization by multi-task learning, the other integrates global-level regularization by harnessing a newly designed grouped consistency evaluator, which adds relation constraints to the proposed network in an adversarial manner. Both schemes are beneficial to the model in training, and can be readily unloaded in inference to achieve real-time detection. We establish a large in-house dataset of ESD surgery for esophageal cancer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, achieving better detection results faster. Promising results on two downstream applications further corroborate the great potential of our method in ESD clinical practice.

Additionally, current methods rely heavily on the use of a well-imitated surrogate NRM to guarantee the attack effect, which makes them difficult to use in practice. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to produce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and humans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model, such as BART, to generate connection sentences without introducing easy-to-detect errors, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance relevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Experimental results on the popular MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM can outperform strong baselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents as evidenced by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, the separation of adversarial text generation from the surrogate NRM makes IDEM more robust and less affected by the quality of the surrogate NRM.

Though the objective function $f := g - \ell$ is still submodular, the fact that $f$ could potentially take on negative values prevents the existing methods for submodular maximization from providing a constant approximation ratio for the regularized submodular maximization problem. To overcome the obstacle, we propose several algorithms which can provide a relatively weak approximation guarantee for maximizing regularized non-monotone submodular functions. More specifically, we propose a continuous greedy algorithm for the relaxation of maximizing $g - \ell$ subject to a matroid constraint. Then, the pipage rounding procedure can produce an integral solution $S$ such that $\mathbb{E} [g(S) - \ell(S)] \geq e^{-1}g(OPT) - \ell(OPT) - O(\epsilon)$.

Prior solutions struggle to maintain reliable accuracy in unconstrained remote gaze tracking. Among them, appearance-based solutions demonstrate tremendous potential in improving gaze accuracy. However, existing works still suffer from head movement and are not robust enough to handle real-world scenarios. Especially most of them study gaze estimation under controlled scenarios where the collected datasets often cover limited ranges of both head-pose and gaze which introduces further bias. In this paper, we propose novel end-to-end appearance-based gaze estimation methods that could more robustly incorporate different levels of head-pose representations into gaze estimation. Our method could generalize to real-world scenarios with low image quality, different lightings and scenarios where direct head-pose information is not available.

In this work, we propose to model the 3D parameter as a random variable instead of a constant as in SDS and present variational score distillation (VSD), a principled particle-based variational framework to explain and address the aforementioned issues in text-to-3D generation.

The LTR3O method introduces a dynamic and reduced-size sequence structure known as 3O, which consists of onset, occurring, and offset frames, for representing micro-expressions (MEs). This structure facilitates the subsequent learning of ME-discriminative features. A noteworthy advantage of the 3O structure is its flexibility, as the occurring frame is randomly extracted from the original ME sequence without the need for accurate frame spotting methods. Based on the 3O structures, LTR3O generates multiple 3O representation candidates for each ME sample and incorporates well-designed modules to measure and calibrate their emotional expressiveness. This calibration process ensures that the distribution of these candidates aligns with that of macro-expressions (MaMs) over time. Consequently, the visibility of MEs can be implicitly enhanced, facilitating the reliable learning of more discriminative features for MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of LTR3O using three widely-used ME databases: CASME II, SMIC, and SAMM. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of LTR3O, particularly in terms of its flexibility and reliability, when compared to recent state-of-the-art MER methods.

0000-0002-0005-9892,Cheng Lu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Layer-Adapted Implicit Distribution Alignment Networks for Cross-Corpus   Speech Emotion Recognition,1970,"  In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) method called layer-adapted implicit distribution alignment networks (LIDAN) to address the challenge of cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER). LIDAN extends our previous ICASSP work, deep implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDAN), whose key contribution lies in the introduction of a novel regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). This term allows DIDAN trained on source (training) speech samples to remain applicable to predicting emotion labels for target (testing) speech samples, regardless of corpus variance in cross-corpus SER. To further enhance this method, we extend IDA to layer-adapted IDA (LIDA), resulting in LIDAN. This layer-adpated extention consists of three modified IDA terms that consider emotion labels at different levels of granularity. These terms are strategically arranged within different fully connected layers in LIDAN, aligning with the increasing emotion-discriminative abilities with respect to the layer depth. This arrangement enables LIDAN to more effectively learn emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features for SER across various corpora compared to DIDAN. It is also worthy to mention that unlike most existing methods that rely on estimating statistical moments to describe pre-assumed explicit distributions, both IDA and LIDA take a different approach. They utilize an idea of target sample reconstruction to directly bridge the feature distribution gap without making assumptions about their distribution type. As a result, DIDAN and LIDAN can be viewed as implicit cross-corpus SER methods. To evaluate LIDAN, we conducted extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA corpora. The experimental results demonstrate that LIDAN surpasses recent state-of-the-art explicit unsupervised DA methods in tackling cross-corpus SER tasks.

0000-0002-0005-9892,Cheng Lu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Towards Domain-Specific Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition Approach,1970,"  Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) poses a challenge due to feature distribution mismatch, potentially degrading the performance of established SER methods. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel transfer subspace learning method called acoustic knowledgeguided transfer linear regression (AKTLR). Unlike existing approaches, which often overlook domain-specific knowledge related to SER and simply treat cross-corpus SER as a generic transfer learning task, our AKTLR method is built upon a well-designed acoustic knowledge-guided dual sparsity constraint mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes the potential of minimalistic acoustic parameter feature sets to alleviate classifier overadaptation, which is empirically validated acoustic knowledge in SER, enabling superior generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks compared to using large feature sets. Through this mechanism, we extend a simple transfer linear regression model to AKTLR. This extension harnesses its full capability to seek emotiondiscriminative and corpus-invariant features from established acoustic parameter feature sets used for describing speech signals across two scales: contributive acoustic parameter groups and constituent elements within each contributive group. Our proposed method is evaluated through extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on three widely-used speech emotion corpora: EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA. The results confirm the effectiveness and superior performance of our method, outperforming recent state-of-the-art transfer subspace learning and deep transfer learning-based cross-corpus SER methods. Furthermore, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the feasibility and superiority of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the transfer learning model to address cross-corpus SER tasks.

Wide-bandgap 2D semiconductors are especially important in blue and ultraviolet wavelength region, while there are very few 2D materials in this region. Here, monolayer \b{eta}-type zirconium nitride chloride (\b{eta}-ZrNCl) is isolated for the first time, which is an air-stable layered material with a bandgap of ~3.0 eV in bulk. Systematical investigation of layer-dependent Raman scattering of ZrNCl from monolayer, bilayer, to bulk reveals a blue shift of its out-of-plane A1g peak at ~189 cm-1. Importantly, this A1g peak is absent in monolayer, suggesting that it is a fingerprint to quickly identify monolayer and for the thickness determination of 2D ZrNCl. The back-gate field-effect transistor based on few-layer ZrNCl shows a high on/off ratio of 108. These results suggest the potential of 2D \b{eta}-ZrNCl for electronic applications.

However, the intricate effect of the magnetic spin configurations on the characteristic electronic structure directly from the kagome lattice layer remains still elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we report the spectroscopic evidence for the spin-reorientation effect of a kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge, which is composed only of the kagome planes. There are two kinds of kagome-derived Dirac fermions due to the structural three-dimensionality -- one is less dispersive ($k_z$ $\sim$ 0) and the other disperses linearly ($k_z$ $\sim$ $\pi$). As the Fe moments cant from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane upon cooling, the Dirac fermion in $k_z$ $\sim$ 0 plane with a mixture of the Fe-$3d_{xy}$ and Fe-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ components evolves from gapped into nearly gapless, while the Dirac cone in $k_z$ $\sim$ $\pi$ plane mainly of the Fe-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character remains intact, suggesting that the effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions has an orbital selectivity. Our unambiguous observations provide a feasible route to design and manipulate the mass of Dirac fermions for realizing the novel quantum phases. We also perform comparative studies between the non-charge-ordered Fe$_3$Ge and its sibling compound FeGe, a newly established charge-density-wave kagome magnet, the results suggest that the orbital-selective van Hove singularities near the Fermi level play an indispensable part in driving the charge order on a magnetic kagome lattice.

However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, kinetic mobility, and synthesis precision, particularly for oxidation-demanding phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy (GOAL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Consequently, thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented at elevated temperatures, improving growth kinetics. We demonstrate the accurate synthesis of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure as a parent of high-temperature superconductivity, in which alternating single and double NiO2 layers possess distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy. The GOAL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.

0000-0002-6935-4208,Ye Liu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Exploiting Constructive Interference for Backscatter Communication   Systems,1970,"  Backscatter communication (BackCom), one of the core technologies to realize zero-power communication, is expected to be a pivotal paradigm for the next generation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ""strong"" direct link (DL) interference (DLI) is traditionally assumed to be harmful, and generally drowns out the ""weak"" backscattered signals accordingly, thus deteriorating the performance of BackCom. In contrast to the previous efforts to eliminate the DLI, in this paper, we exploit the constructive interference (CI), in which the DLI contributes to the backscattered signal. To be specific, our objective is to maximize the received signal power by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vectors and tag selection factors, which is, however, non-convex and difficult to solve due to constraints on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In order to solve this problem, we first decompose the original problem, and then propose two algorithms to solve the sub-problem with beamforming design via a change of variables and semi-definite programming (SDP) and a greedy algorithm to solve the sub-problem with tag selection. In order to gain insight into the CI, we consider a special case with the single-antenna reader to reveal the channel angle between the backscattering link (BL) and the DL, in which the DLI will become constructive. Simulation results show that significant performance gain can always be achieved in the proposed algorithms compared with the traditional algorithms without the DL in terms of the strength of the received signal. The derived constructive channel angle for the BackCom system with the single-antenna reader is also confirmed by simulation results.

The former focuses on achieving functional goals and the latter aims at creating engaging social conversations without special goals. Creating a unified conversational model that can engage in both chit-chat and task-oriented dialogue is a promising research topic in recent years. However, the potential ``initiative'' that occurs when there is a change between dialogue modes in one dialogue has rarely been explored. In this work, we investigate two kinds of dialogue scenarios, one starts from chit-chat implicitly involving task-related topics and finally switching to task-oriented requests; the other starts from task-oriented interaction and eventually changes to casual chat after all requested information is provided. We contribute two efficient prompt models which can proactively generate a transition sentence to trigger system-initiated transitions in a unified dialogue model. One is a discrete prompt model trained with two discrete tokens, the other one is a continuous prompt model using continuous prompt embeddings automatically generated by a classifier. We furthermore show that the continuous prompt model can also be used to guide the proactive transitions between particular domains in a multi-domain task-oriented setting.

We firstly build a {transition info extractor} (TIE) that keeps track of the preceding chit-chat interaction and detects the potential user intention to switch to a task-oriented service. Meanwhile, in the unified model, a {transition sentence generator} (TSG) is extended through efficient Adapter tuning and transition prompt learning. When the TIE successfully finds task-related information from the preceding chit-chat, such as a transition domain, then the TSG is activated automatically in the unified model to initiate this transition by generating a transition sentence under the guidance of transition information extracted by TIE. The experimental results show promising performance regarding the proactive transitions. We achieve an additional large improvement on TIE model by utilizing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The TSG can flexibly generate transition sentences while maintaining the unified capabilities of normal chit-chat and task-oriented response generation.

To this end, we embed existing properties into a vector database and retrieve a reference property for LLM-based in-context learning to generate a new prop- erty for a given code. While this basic process is relatively straight- forward, ensuring that the generated properties are (i) compilable, (ii) appropriate, and (iii) runtime-verifiable presents challenges. To address (i), we use the compilation and static analysis feedback as an external oracle to guide LLMs in iteratively revising the generated properties. For (ii), we consider multiple dimensions of similarity to rank the properties and employ a weighted algorithm to identify the top-K properties as the final result. For (iii), we design a dedicated prover to formally verify the correctness of the generated prop- erties. We have implemented these strategies into a novel system called PropertyGPT, with 623 human-written properties collected from 23 Certora projects. Our experiments show that PropertyGPT can generate comprehensive and high-quality properties, achieving an 80% recall compared to the ground truth.

The primary methodologies employed for FSRE have been fine-tuning or prompt tuning techniques based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted numerous researchers to explore FSRE through In-Context Learning (ICL). However, there are substantial limitations associated with methods based on either traditional RE models or LLMs. Traditional RE models are hampered by a lack of necessary prior knowledge, while LLMs fall short in their task-specific capabilities for RE. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-System Augmented Relation Extractor (DSARE), which synergistically combines traditional RE models with LLMs. Specifically, DSARE innovatively injects the prior knowledge of LLMs into traditional RE models, and conversely enhances LLMs' task-specific aptitude for RE through relation extraction augmentation. Moreover, an Integrated Prediction module is employed to jointly consider these two respective predictions and derive the final results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0E0EB6F0>,Yes,"innovative(1), innovatively(1)"

In response, regulatory measures like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven the exploration of Machine Unlearning techniques, which aim to enable models to selectively forget certain data entries. While early approaches focused on pre-processing methods, recent research has shifted towards training-based machine unlearning methods. However, many existing methods require access to original training data, posing challenges in scenarios where such data is unavailable. Besides, directly facilitating unlearning may undermine the language model's general expressive ability. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which addresses these challenges by incorporating three key components. We propose a Knowledge Unlearning Induction module for unlearning specific target sequences and a Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to prevent degrading in generation capacity. Additionally, an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module is integrated to make the process more adaptive to each target sample respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICU in maintaining performance while efficiently unlearning sensitive information, offering a promising avenue for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.

However, the centralized training of these Legal LLMs raises data privacy concerns, as legal data is distributed among various institutions containing sensitive individual information. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring the integration of Legal LLMs with Federated Learning (FL) methodologies. By employing FL, Legal LLMs can be fine-tuned locally on devices or clients, and their parameters are aggregated and distributed on a central server, ensuring data privacy without directly sharing raw data. However, computation and communication overheads hinder the full fine-tuning of LLMs under the FL setting. Moreover, the distribution shift of legal data reduces the effectiveness of FL methods. To this end, in this paper, we propose the first Federated Legal Large Language Model (FedJudge) framework, which fine-tunes Legal LLMs efficiently and effectively. Specifically, FedJudge utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to update only a few additional parameters during the FL training. Besides, we explore the continual learning methods to preserve the global model's important parameters when training local clients to mitigate the problem of data shifts. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of FedJudge. Code is released at https://github.com/yuelinan/FedJudge.

0000-0002-6935-4208,Ye Liu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Point cloud ridge-valley feature enhancement based on position and   normal guidance,1970,"  Ridge-valley features are important elements of point clouds, as they contain rich surface information. To recognize these features from point clouds, this paper introduces an extreme point distance (EPD) criterion with scale independence. Compared with traditional methods, the EPD greatly reduces the number of potential feature points and improves the robustness of multiscale feature point recognition. On this basis, a feature enhancement algorithm based on user priori guidance is proposed that adjusts the coordinates of the feature area by solving an objective equation containing the expected position and normal constraints. Since the expected normal can be expressed as a function of neighborhood point coordinates, the above objective equation can be converted into linear sparse equations with enhanced feature positions as variables, and thus, the closed solution can be obtained. In addition, a parameterization method for scattered point clouds based on feature line guidance is proposed, which reduces the number of unknowns by 2/3 and eliminates lateral sliding in the direction perpendicular to feature lines. Finally, the application of the algorithm in multiscale ridge-valley feature recognition, freeform surface feature enhancement and computer-aided design (CAD) workpiece sharp feature restoration verifies its effectiveness.

Upon increasing pressure, two strong peaks associated with the Ce-$4f$ states emerge near the Fermi level, and the $c$-$f$ hybridization and valence state fluctuation are enhanced remarkably. Moreover, the kinetic and potential energies raise, while the occupancy, total angular momentum, and low-energy scattering rate of the Ce-$4f$ electrons decline with respect to pressure.

This method is based on the pole representation of Matsubara Green's function and a stochastic sampling procedure is utilized to optimize the amplitudes and locations of poles. In order to capture narrow peaks and sharp band edges in the spectral functions, a constrained sampling algorithm and a self-adaptive sampling algorithm are developed. To demonstrate the usefulness and performance of the new method, we at first apply it to study the spectral functions of representative fermionic and bosonic correlators. Then we employ this method to tackle the analytic continuation problems of matrix-valued Green's functions. The synthetic Green's functions, as well as realistic correlation functions from finite temperature quantum many-body calculations, are used as input. The benchmark results demonstrate that this method is capable of reproducing most of the key characteristics in the spectral functions. The sharp, smooth, and multi-peak features in both low-frequency and high-frequency regions of spectral functions could be accurately resolved, which overcomes one of the main limitations of the traditional maximum entropy method. More importantly, it exhibits excellent robustness with respect to noisy and incomplete input data. The causality of spectral function is always satisfied even in the presence of sizable noises. As a byproduct, this method could derive a fitting formula for the Matsubara data, which provides a compact approximation to the many-body Green's functions. Hence, we expect that this new method could become a pivotal workhorse for numerically analytic continuation and be broadly useful in many applications.

This study explores the effectiveness of Energy-Based Models in calibrating confidence for speech classification tasks by training a joint EBM integrating a discriminative and a generative model, thereby enhancing the classifiers calibration and mitigating overconfidence. Experimental evaluations conducted on three speech classification tasks specifically: age, emotion, and language recognition. Our findings highlight the competitive performance of EBMs in calibrating the speech classification models. This research emphasizes the potential of EBMs in speech classification tasks, demonstrating their ability to enhance calibration without sacrificing accuracy.

Analyzing these pandemic-induced patterns is imperative to identify the potential risks and impacts of this extreme event. With this purpose, we developed an open-access data hub (COVID-EMDA+), an open-source toolbox (CoVEMDA), and a few evaluation methods to explore what the U.S. power systems are experiencing during COVID-19. These resources could be broadly used for research, public policy, and educational purposes. Technically, our data hub harmonizes a variety of raw data such as generation mix, demand profiles, electricity price, weather observations, mobility, confirmed cases and deaths. Typical methods are reformulated and standardized in our toolbox, including baseline estimation, regression analysis, and scientific visualization. Here the fluctuation index and probabilistic baseline are proposed for the first time to consider data fluctuation and estimation uncertainty. Based on these, we conduct three empirical studies on the U.S. power systems, and share new solutions and unexpected findings to address the issues of public concerns. This conveys a more complete picture of the pandemic's impacts, and also opens up several attractive topics for future work.

0000-0003-2523-5810,Jie Lei,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Guided Hybrid Quantization for Object detection in Multimodal Remote   Sensing Imagery via One-to-one Self-teaching,1970,"  Considering the computation complexity, we propose a Guided Hybrid Quantization with One-to-one Self-Teaching (GHOST}) framework. More concretely, we first design a structure called guided quantization self-distillation (GQSD), which is an innovative idea for realizing lightweight through the synergy of quantization and distillation. The training process of the quantization model is guided by its full-precision model, which is time-saving and cost-saving without preparing a huge pre-trained model in advance. Second, we put forward a hybrid quantization (HQ) module to obtain the optimal bit width automatically under a constrained condition where a threshold for distribution distance between the center and samples is applied in the weight value search space. Third, in order to improve information transformation, we propose a one-to-one self-teaching (OST) module to give the student network a ability of self-judgment. A switch control machine (SCM) builds a bridge between the student network and teacher network in the same location to help the teacher to reduce wrong guidance and impart vital knowledge to the student. This distillation method allows a model to learn from itself and gain substantial improvement without any additional supervision. Extensive experiments on a multimodal dataset (VEDAI) and single-modality datasets (DOTA, NWPU, and DIOR) show that object detection based on GHOST outperforms the existing detectors. The tiny parameters (<9.7 MB) and Bit-Operations (BOPs) (<2158 G) compared with any remote sensing-based, lightweight or distillation-based algorithms demonstrate the superiority in the lightweight design domain.

0000-0003-2523-5810,Jie Lei,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",AFPN: Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection,1970,"  Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks.

To tackle this, we introduce the Multimodal Informative Vit (MIVit), a system with an innovative information aggregate-distributing mechanism. This approach redefines redundancy levels and integrates performance-aware elements into the fused representation, facilitating the learning of semantics in both forward and backward directions. MIVit stands out by significantly reducing redundancy in the empirical distribution of each modality's separate and fused features. It employs oriented attention fusion (OAF) for extracting shallow local features across modalities in horizontal and vertical dimensions, and a Transformer feature extractor for extracting deep global features through long-range attention. We also propose an information aggregation constraint (IAC) based on mutual information, designed to remove redundant information and preserve complementary information within embedded features. Additionally, the information distribution flow (IDF) in MIVit enhances performance-awareness by distributing global classification information across different modalities' feature maps. This architecture also addresses missing modality challenges with lightweight independent modality classifiers, reducing the computational load typically associated with Transformers. Our results show that MIVit's bidirectional aggregate-distributing mechanism between modalities is highly effective, achieving an average overall accuracy of 95.56% across three multimodal datasets. This performance surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in MLCC. The code for MIVit is accessible at https://github.com/icey-zhang/MIViT.

However, recent deep learning algorithms have predominantly focused on detecting cloud regions in satellite imagery, with insufficient attention to the specificity required for accurate cloud recognition. This limitation inspired us to develop the novel FY-4A-Himawari-8 (FYH) dataset, which includes nine distinct cloud categories and uses precise domain adaptation methods to align 70,419 image-label pairs in terms of projection, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution, thereby facilitating the training of supervised deep learning networks. Given the complexity and diversity of cloud formations, we have thoroughly analyzed the challenges inherent to cloud recognition tasks, examining the intricate characteristics and distribution of the data. To effectively address these challenges, we designed a Distribution-aware Interactive-Attention Network (DIAnet), which preserves pixel-level details through a high-resolution branch and a parallel multi-resolution cross-branch. We also integrated a distribution-aware loss (DAL) to mitigate the imbalance across cloud categories. An Interactive Attention Module (IAM) further enhances the robustness of feature extraction combined with spatial and channel information. Empirical evaluations on the FYH dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms other cloud recognition networks, achieving superior performance in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).

This paper evaluates KWS utilizing a learning automata powered machine learning algorithm called the Tsetlin Machine (TM). Through significant reduction in parameter requirements and choosing logic over arithmetic based processing, the TM offers new opportunities for low-power KWS while maintaining high learning efficacy. In this paper we explore a TM based keyword spotting (KWS) pipeline to demonstrate low complexity with faster rate of convergence compared to NNs.

0000-0002-3238-7495,Yifan Wu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",The Laplacian in RL: Learning Representations with Efficient   Approximations,1970,"  The smallest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are well-known to provide a succinct representation of the geometry of a weighted graph. In reinforcement learning (RL), where the weighted graph may be interpreted as the state transition process induced by a behavior policy acting on the environment, approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian provides a promising approach to state representation learning. However, existing methods for performing this approximation are ill-suited in general RL settings for two main reasons: First, they are computationally expensive, often requiring operations on large matrices. Second, these methods lack adequate justification beyond simple, tabular, finite-state settings. In this paper, we present a fully general and scalable method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in a model-free RL context. We systematically evaluate our approach and empirically show that it generalizes beyond the tabular, finite-state setting. Even in tabular, finite-state settings, its ability to approximate the eigenvectors outperforms previous proposals. Finally, we show the potential benefits of using a Laplacian representation learned using our method in goal-achieving RL tasks, providing evidence that our technique can be used to significantly improve the performance of an RL agent.

However, this might limit their adaptability to an increasing set of anomaly detection tasks due to the priors in the selection of auxiliary datasets or the strategy of anomaly simulation. To tackle this challenge, we first introduce a prior-less anomaly generation paradigm and subsequently develop an innovative unsupervised anomaly detection framework named GRAD, grounded in this paradigm. GRAD comprises three essential components: (1) a diffusion model (PatchDiff) to generate contrastive patterns by preserving the local structures while disregarding the global structures present in normal images, (2) a self-supervised reweighting mechanism to handle the challenge of long-tailed and unlabeled contrastive patterns generated by PatchDiff, and (3) a lightweight patch-level detector to efficiently distinguish the normal patterns and reweighted contrastive patterns. The generation results of PatchDiff effectively expose various types of anomaly patterns, e.g. structural and logical anomaly patterns. In addition, extensive experiments on both MVTec AD and MVTec LOCO datasets also support the aforementioned observation and demonstrate that GRAD achieves competitive anomaly detection accuracy and superior inference speed.

0000-0002-3238-7495,Yifan Wu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Log Parsing with Self-Generated In-Context Learning and Self-Correction,1970,"  Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as a crucial step for log analysis. Despite a variety of log parsing methods that have been proposed, their performance on evolving log data remains unsatisfactory due to reliance on human-crafted rules or learning-based models with limited training data. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong abilities in understanding natural language and code, making it promising to apply LLMs for log parsing. Consequently, several studies have proposed LLM-based log parsers. However, LLMs may produce inaccurate templates, and existing LLM-based log parsers directly use the template generated by the LLM as the parsing result, hindering the accuracy of log parsing. Furthermore, these log parsers depend heavily on historical log data as demonstrations, which poses challenges in maintaining accuracy when dealing with scarce historical log data or evolving log data. To address these challenges, we propose AdaParser, an effective and adaptive log parsing framework using LLMs with self-generated in-context learning (SG-ICL) and self-correction. To facilitate accurate log parsing, AdaParser incorporates a novel component, a template corrector, which utilizes the LLM to correct potential parsing errors in the templates it generates. In addition, AdaParser maintains a dynamic candidate set composed of previously generated templates as demonstrations to adapt evolving log data. Extensive experiments on public large-scale datasets show that AdaParser outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, even in zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, when integrated with different LLMs, AdaParser consistently enhances the performance of the utilized LLMs by a large margin.

This framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA) mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets. Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of LorentzNet and a series of Lorentz-equivariant methods, but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25% at a 30% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3% on the quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters and 53% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity. For very large datasets, we double the dimension of particle embeddings, referring to this variant as MIParT-Large (MIParT-L). We find that MIParT-L can further capitalize on the knowledge from large datasets. From a model pre-trained on the 100M JetClass dataset, the background rejection performance of the fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by 39% on the top tagging dataset and by 6% on the quark-gluon dataset, surpassing that of the fine-tuned ParT. Specifically, the background rejection of fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by an additional 2% compared to the fine-tuned ParT. The results suggest that MIParT has the potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event identification in particle physics.

To this end, we first curate a large-scale dataset, named ChartInsights, consisting of 89,388 quartets (chart, task, question, answer) and covering 10 widely-used low-level data analysis tasks on 7 chart types. Firstly, we conduct systematic evaluations to understand the capabilities and limitations of 18 advanced MLLMs, which include 12 open-source models and 6 closed-source models. Starting with a standard textual prompt approach, the average accuracy rate across the 18 MLLMs is 36.17%. Among all the models, GPT-4V achieves the highest accuracy, reaching 56.13%. To understand the limitations of multimodal large models in low-level data analysis tasks, we have designed various experiments to conduct an in-depth test of capabilities of GPT-4V. We further investigate how visual modifications to charts, such as altering visual elements (e.g. changing color schemes) and introducing perturbations (e.g. adding image noise), affect performance of GPT-4V.

The fast expansion of available biological data enables computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them, deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI. BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification, BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various antiviral drugs.

An algorithm should ideally be able to trust an imperfect model over a reasonably long planning horizon, and only rely on model-free updates when the model errors get infeasibly large. In this paper, we investigate techniques for choosing the planning horizon on a state-dependent basis, where a state's planning horizon is determined by the maximum cumulative model error around that state. We demonstrate that these state-dependent model errors can be learned with Temporal Difference methods, based on a novel approach of temporally decomposing the cumulative model errors. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully adapt the planning horizon to account for state-dependent model accuracy, significantly improving the efficiency of policy learning compared to model-based and model-free baselines.

0000-0002-3238-7495,Yifan Wu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Unsupervised Learning of Multi-level Structures for Anomaly Detection,1970,"  The main difficulty in high-dimensional anomaly detection tasks is the lack of anomalous data for training. And simply collecting anomalous data from the real world, common distributions, or the boundary of normal data manifold may face the problem of missing anomaly modes. This paper first introduces a novel method to generate anomalous data by breaking up global structures while preserving local structures of normal data at multiple levels. It can efficiently expose local abnormal structures of various levels. To fully exploit the exposed multi-level abnormal structures, we propose to train multiple level-specific patch-based detectors with contrastive losses. Each detector learns to detect local abnormal structures of corresponding level at all locations and outputs patchwise anomaly scores. By aggregating the outputs of all level-specific detectors, we obtain a model that can detect all potential anomalies. The effectiveness is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet10 dataset, where the results surpass the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods.

0000-0002-3238-7495,Yifan Wu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in   Transformers for Long Context Window Extending,1970,"  Self-attention and position embedding are two key modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors harming long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention unveiled by our work. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (Collinear Constrained Attention). Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between $Q$ and $K$ to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention. While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive experiments show that CoCA performs extraordinarily well in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can seamlessly extend the context window up to 32K (60$\times$), without any fine-tuning. Additionally, by dropping CoCA in LLaMA-7B, we achieve extrapolation up to 32K within only 2K training length.

Analysts conducting exploratory analyses do not, however, know all queries in advance and seldom have DP expertise. Thus, they are limited in their ability to specify $\epsilon$ allotments across queries prior to an analysis. To support analysts in spending $\epsilon$ efficiently, we propose a new interactive analysis paradigm, Measure-Observe-Remeasure, where analysts ``measure'' the database with a limited amount of $\epsilon$, observe estimates and their errors, and remeasure with more $\epsilon$ as needed.   We instantiate the paradigm in an interactive visualization interface which allows analysts to spend increasing amounts of $\epsilon$ under a total budget. To observe how analysts interact with the Measure-Observe-Remeasure paradigm via the interface, we conduct a user study that compares the utility of $\epsilon$ allocations and findings from sensitive data participants make to the allocations and findings expected of a rational agent who faces the same decision task. We find that participants are able to use the workflow relatively successfully, including using budget allocation strategies that maximize over half of the available utility stemming from $\epsilon$ allocation.

Accurate estimation requires comprehensive datasets of food scenes, including images, segmentation masks, and accompanying dietary intake metadata. In this paper, we introduce NutritionVerse-Real, an open access manually collected 2D food scene dataset for dietary intake estimation with 889 images of 251 distinct dishes and 45 unique food types. The NutritionVerse-Real dataset was created by manually collecting images of food scenes in real life, measuring the weight of every ingredient and computing the associated dietary content of each dish using the ingredient weights and nutritional information from the food packaging or the Canada Nutrient File. Segmentation masks were then generated through human labelling of the images. We provide further analysis on the data diversity to highlight potential biases when using this data to develop models for dietary intake estimation. NutritionVerse-Real is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nutritionverse/nutritionverse-real as part of an open initiative to accelerate machine learning for dietary sensing.

0000-0002-3238-7495,Yifan Wu,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Generating Synthetic X-ray Images of a Person from the Surface Geometry,1970,"  We present a novel framework that learns to predict human anatomy from body surface. Specifically, our approach generates a synthetic X-ray image of a person only from the person's surface geometry. Furthermore, the synthetic X-ray image is parametrized and can be manipulated by adjusting a set of body markers which are also generated during the X-ray image prediction. With the proposed framework, multiple synthetic X-ray images can easily be generated by varying surface geometry. By perturbing the parameters, several additional synthetic X-ray images can be generated from the same surface geometry. As a result, our approach offers a potential to overcome the training data barrier in the medical domain. This capability is achieved by learning a pair of networks - one learns to generate the full image from the partial image and a set of parameters, and the other learns to estimate the parameters given the full image. During training, the two networks are trained iteratively such that they would converge to a solution where the predicted parameters and the full image are consistent with each other. In addition to medical data enrichment, our framework can also be used for image completion as well as anomaly detection.

However, these methods still face several challenges, such as lack of cross-platform generality and cross-task flexibility. Fortunately, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) can significantly address these challenges, and many approaches have already been proposed to explore this field. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the differences between LLM-based AIOps and traditional AIOps methods. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIOps technology for failure management in the LLM era. It includes a detailed definition of AIOps tasks for failure management, the data sources for AIOps, and the LLM-based approaches adopted for AIOps. Additionally, this survey explores the AIOps subtasks, the specific LLM-based approaches suitable for different AIOps subtasks, and the challenges and future directions of the domain, aiming to further its development and application.

The advent of machine learning offers a promising solution, while the development of such technologies is hindered by the scarcity of data on rare conditions and the demand for models that are both interpretable and trustworthy in a clinical context. Interpretable AI, with its capacity for human-readable outputs, can facilitate validation by clinicians and contribute to medical education. In the current work, we focus on choroid neoplasias, the most prevalent form of eye cancer in adults, albeit rare with 5.1 per million. We built the so-far largest dataset consisting of 750 patients, incorporating three distinct imaging modalities collected from 2004 to 2022. Our work introduces a concept-based interpretable model that distinguishes between three types of choroidal tumors, integrating insights from domain experts via radiological reports. Remarkably, this model not only achieves an F1 score of 0.91, rivaling that of black-box models, but also boosts the diagnostic accuracy of junior doctors by 42%. This study highlights the significant potential of interpretable machine learning in improving the diagnosis of rare diseases, laying a groundwork for future breakthroughs in medical AI that could tackle a wider array of complex health scenarios.

Severe interference in ultra-dense networks poses a key bottleneck. Sharing channel state information (CSI) and messages across transmitters can potentially alleviate interferences and improve system performance. Most existing works on interference coordination require significant CSI signaling overhead and are impractical in ultra-dense networks. This paper investigate topological cooperation to manage interferences in message sharing based only on network connectivity information. In particular, we propose a generalized low-rank optimization approach to maximize achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). To tackle the challenges of poor structure and non-convex rank function, we develop Riemannian optimization algorithms to solve a sequence of complex fixed rank subproblems through a rank growth strategy. By exploiting the non-compact Stiefel manifold formed by the set of complex full column rank matrices, we develop Riemannian optimization algorithms to solve the complex fixed-rank optimization problem by applying the semidefinite lifting technique and Burer-Monteiro factorization approach. Numerical results demonstrate the computational efficiency and higher DoFs achieved by the proposed algorithms.

Solutions on the energy surface of the ground state are characterized. We prove that solutions with kinetic energy less than that of the ground state must scatter to zero or belong to the stable/unstable manifolds of the ground state. In the latter case they converge to the ground state exponentially in the energy space as $t\to \infty$ or $t\to -\infty$. (In 3-dim without radial assumption, this holds under the compactness assumption of non-scattering solutions on the energy surface.) When the kinetic energy is greater than that of the ground state, we show that all radial $H^1$ solutions blow up in finite time, with the only two exceptions in the case of 5-dim which belong to the stable/unstable manifold of the ground state. The proof relies on the detailed spectral analysis, local invariant manifold theory, and a global Virial analysis.

Based on previous research by medical professionals, preventable readmissions are caused by such factors as flawed patient discharging process, inadequate follow-ups after discharging, and noncompliance of patients on discharging and follow up instructions. It is also found that the risk of preventable readmission also may relate to some patient's characteristics, such as age, health condition, diagnosis, and even treatment specialty. In this study, using both general demographic information and individual past history of readmission records, we develop a risk prediction model based on hierarchical nonlinear mixed effect framework to extract significant prognostic factors associated with patient risk of 30-day readmission. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated based on a real dataset from four VA facilities in the State of Michigan. Simultaneously explaining both patient and population based variations of readmission process, such an accurate model can be used to recognize patients with high likelihood of discharging non-compliances, and then targeted post-care actions can be designed to reduce further rehospitalization.

Nevertheless, such cooperations require the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at base stations (BSs), which is assumed to be perfectly known. However, CSI errors are inevitable in practice which necessitates beamforming techniques that can achieve robust performance in the presence of channel estimation errors. Existing approaches relax the robust beamforming design problems into semidefinite programming (SDP), which can only achieve a solution that is far from being optimal. To this end, this paper views robust beamforming design problems from a bilevel optimization perspective. In particular, we focus on maximizing the worst-case weighted sum-rate (WSR) in the downlink multi-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system considering bounded CSI errors. We first reformulate this problem into a bilevel optimization problem and then develop an efficient algorithm based on the cutting plane method. A distributed optimization algorithm has also been developed to facilitate the parallel processing in practical settings. Numerical results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and complexity, particularly in the presence of CSI uncertainties.

0000-0001-5571-6645,Kai Yang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",A predictive analytics approach to reducing avoidable hospital   readmission,1970,"  Hospital readmission has become a critical metric of quality and cost of healthcare. Medicare anticipates that nearly $17 billion is paid out on the 20% of patients who are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Although several interventions such as transition care management and discharge reengineering have been practiced in recent years, the effectiveness and sustainability depends on how well they can identify and target patients at high risk of rehospitalization. Based on the literature, most current risk prediction models fail to reach an acceptable accuracy level; none of them considers patient's history of readmission and impacts of patient attribute changes over time; and they often do not discriminate between planned and unnecessary readmissions. Tackling such drawbacks, we develop a new readmission metric based on administrative data that can identify potentially avoidable readmissions from all other types of readmission. We further propose a tree based classification method to estimate the predicted probability of readmission that can directly incorporate patient's history of readmission and risk factors changes over time. The proposed methods are validated with 2011-12 Veterans Health Administration data from inpatients hospitalized for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the State of Michigan. Results shows improved discrimination power compared to the literature (c-statistics>80%) and good calibration.

The first kind is inelastic 2-to-2 meson-meson scattering that is governed by quark interchange as well as quark-antiquark annihilation and creation. Cross-section formulas are provided to get unpolarized cross sections for $\pi K \to \rho K^\ast$ for $I=1/2$, $\pi K^\ast \to \rho K$ for $I=1/2$, $\pi K^\ast \to \rho K^\ast$ for $I=1/2$, and $\rho K \to \rho K^\ast$ for $I=1/2$. Near threshold, quark interchange dominates the reactions near the critical temperature. The second kind is 2-to-1 meson-meson scattering with the process that a quark in an initial meson and an antiquark in another initial meson annihilate into a gluon and subsequently the gluon is absorbed by the other antiquark or quark. The transition potential for the process is derived. Four Feynman diagrams at tree level contribute to the 2-to-1 meson-meson scattering. Starting from the $S$-matrix element, the isospin-averaged unpolarized cross section with transition amplitudes is derived. The cross sections for $\pi \pi \to \rho$ and $\pi K \to K^*$ decrease with increasing temperature.

0000-0001-5571-6645,Kai Yang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",A Holistic Robust Motion Controller Framework for Autonomous Platooning,1970,"  Safety is the foremost concern for autonomous platooning. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delay and the sudden appearance of obstacles will trigger the safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) issues for autonomous platooning. This research proposes a holistic robust motion controller framework (MCF) for an intelligent and connected vehicle platoon system. The MCF utilizes a hierarchical structure to resolve the longitudinal string stability and the lateral control problem under the complex driving environment and time-varying communication delay. Firstly, the H-infinity feedback controller is developed to ensure the robustness of the platoon under time-varying communication delay in the upper-level coordination layer (UCL). The output from UCL will be delivered to the lower-level motion-planning layer (LML) as reference signals. Secondly, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is implemented in the LML to achieve multi-objective control, which comprehensively considers the reference signals, the artificial potential field, and multiple vehicle dynamics constraints. Furthermore, three critical scenarios are co-simulated for case studies, including platooning under time-varying communication delay, merging, and obstacle avoidance scenarios. The simulation results indicate that, compared with single-structure MPC, the proposed MCF can offer a better suppression on position error propagation, and get improvements on maximum position error in the three scenarios by $19.2\%$, $59.8\%$, and $15.3\%$, respectively. Last, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed MCF are verified via hardware-in-the-loop experiment. The average conducting time of the proposed method on Speedgoat real-time target machine is 1.1 milliseconds, which meets the real-time requirements.

In light of this imperative, we propose an innovative fusion algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which aims to deal with the difficulty in applying deep learning (DL) algorithms due to the instantaneous nature of jamming signals in practical communication systems. Compared with previous methods, our algorithm embeds jamming category labels to constrain the range of generated signals in the frequency domain by using the CGAN model, which simultaneously captures potential label information while learning the distribution of signal data thus achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy even when working with a few-sample dataset. Real-world satellite communication scenarios are simulated by adopting hardware platform, and we validate our algorithm by using the resulting time-domain waveform data. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm still performs extremely well, which demonstrates significant potential for practical application in real-world communication scenarios.

We previously proposed a scheme using kV scattered x-ray photons for marker-less real-time image guidance in lung cancer radiotherapy. This study reports our recently progress using the photon counting detection technique to demonstrate potential feasibility of this method and using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and ray-tracing calculations to characterize the performance. In our scheme, a thin slice of x-ray beam was directed to the target and we measured the outgoing scattered photons using a photon counting detector with a parallel-hole collimator to establish the correspondence between detector pixels and scatter positions. Image corrections of geometry, beam attenuation and scattering angle were performed to convert the raw image to the actual image of Compton attenuation coefficient. We set up a MC simulation system using an in-house developed GPU-based MC package modeling the image formation process. We also performed ray-tracing calculations to investigate the impacts of imaging system geometry on resulting image resolution. The experiment demonstrated feasibility of using a photon counting detector to measure scattered x-ray photons and generate the proposed scattered x-ray image. After correction, x-ray scattering image intensity and Compton scattering attenuation coefficient were linearly related, with R2=0.91. Contrast to Noise Ratios of different objects were improved and the values in experimental results and MC simulation results agreed with each other. Ray-tracing calculations revealed the dependence of image resolution on imaging geometry. The image resolution increases with reduced source to object distance and increased collimator height. The study demonstrated potential feasibility of using scattered x-ray imaging as a real-time image guidance method in radiation therapy.

0000-0001-5571-6645,Kai Yang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Millimeter Wave Communications for Future Mobile Networks,1970,"  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have recently attracted large research interest, since the huge available bandwidth can potentially lead to rates of multiple Gbps (gigabit per second) per user. Though mmWave can be readily used in stationary scenarios such as indoor hotspots or backhaul, it is challenging to use mmWave in mobile networks, where the transmitting/receiving nodes may be moving, channels may have a complicated structure, and the coordination among multiple nodes is difficult. To fully exploit the high potential rates of mmWave in mobile networks, lots of technical problems must be addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of mmWave communications for future mobile networks (5G and beyond). We first summarize the recent channel measurement campaigns and modeling results. Then, we discuss in detail recent progresses in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transceiver design for mmWave communications. After that, we provide an overview of the solution for multiple access and backhauling, followed by analysis of coverage and connectivity. Finally, the progresses in the standardization and deployment of mmWave for mobile networks are discussed.

At these length scales, the exchange interaction plays important roles, such as in the stabilization of spin-quantization axes, the production of spin frustration, and creation of magnetic ordering. Here, we demonstrate the precise control of the exchange bias experienced by a single atom on a surface, covering an energy range of four orders of magnitude. The exchange interaction is continuously tunable from milli-eV to micro-eV by adjusting the separation between a spin-1/2 atom on a surface and the magnetic tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We seamlessly combine inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to map out the different energy scales. This control of exchange bias over a wide span of energies provides versatile control of spin states, with applications ranging from precise tuning of quantum state properties, to strong exchange bias for local spin doping. In addition we show that a time-varying exchange interaction generates a localized AC magnetic field that resonantly drives the surface spin. The static and dynamic control of the exchange interaction at the atomic-scale provides a new tool to tune the quantum states of coupled-spin systems.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a simple and computationally efficient defense strategy: inject random Gaussian noise, discretize each pixel, and then feed the result into any pre-trained classifier. Theoretically, we show that our randomized discretization strategy reduces the KL divergence between original and adversarial inputs, leading to a lower bound on the classification accuracy of any classifier against any (potentially whitebox) $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversarial attack. Empirically, we evaluate our defense on adversarial examples generated by a strong iterative PGD attack. On ImageNet, our defense is more robust than adversarially-trained networks and the winning defenses of the NIPS 2017 Adversarial Attacks & Defenses competition.

This paper focuses on the privacy concerns associated with delay-based localization, where unauthorized base stations attempt to infer the location of the end user. We propose a method to disrupt localization at unauthorized nodes by injecting artificial components into the pilot signal, exploiting model mismatches inherent in these nodes. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of two techniques, namely artificial multipath (AM) and artificial noise (AN), in mitigating location leakage. By leveraging the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound framework, we evaluate the impact of these techniques on unauthorized localization performance. Our results demonstrate that pilot manipulation significantly degrades the accuracy of unauthorized localization while minimally affecting legitimate localization. Moreover, we find that the superiority of AM over AN varies depending on the specific scenario.

In this work, we introduce Tarsier, a family of large-scale video-language models designed to generate high-quality video descriptions. Tarsier employs CLIP-ViT to encode frames separately and then uses an LLM to model temporal relationships. Despite its simple architecture, we demonstrate that with a meticulously designed two-stage training procedure, the Tarsier models exhibit substantially stronger video description capabilities than any existing open-source model, showing a $+51.4\%$ advantage in human side-by-side evaluation over the strongest model. Additionally, they are comparable to state-of-the-art proprietary models, with a $+12.3\%$ advantage against GPT-4V and a $-6.7\%$ disadvantage against Gemini 1.5 Pro. Besides video description, Tarsier proves to be a versatile generalist model, achieving new state-of-the-art results across nine public benchmarks, including multi-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, and zero-shot video captioning. Our second contribution is the introduction of a new benchmark for evaluating video description models, consisting of a new challenging dataset featuring videos from diverse sources and varying complexity, along with an automatic method specifically designed to assess the quality of fine-grained video descriptions.

Open questions remain, however, about why these stories are scary and more generally what scares people. In this study, we explore these questions by analyzing tens of thousands of scary stories on forums (known as subreddits) in a social media website, Reddit. We first explore how writing styles have evolved to keep these stories fresh before we analyze the stable core techniques writers use to make stories scary. We find that writers have changed the themes of their stories over years from haunted houses to school-related themes, body horror, and diseases. Yet some features remain stable; words associated with pseudo-human nouns, such as clown or devil are more common in scary stories than baselines. In addition, we collect a range of datasets that annotate sentences containing fear. We use these data to develop a high-accuracy fear detection neural network model, which is used to quantify where people express fear in scary stories. We find that sentences describing fear, and words most often seen in scary stories, spike at particular points in a story, possibly as a way to keep the readers on the edge of their seats until the story's conclusion. These results provide a new understanding of how authors cater to their readers, and how fear may manifest in stories.

We introduce true-time delayer (TTD)-incorporated analog beamfocusing techniques designed to address the interplay between near-field propagation and wideband beamsplit, an uncharted domain in existing literature. Our approach to maximizing secrecy rates involves formulating an optimization problem for joint power allocation and analog beamformer design, employing a two-stage process encompassing a semi-digital solution and analog approximation. This problem is efficiently solved through a combination of alternating optimization, fractional programming, and block successive upper-bound minimization techniques. Additionally, we present a low-complexity beamsplit-aware beamfocusing strategy, capitalizing on geometric insights from near-field wideband propagation, which can also serve as a robust initial value for the optimization-based approach. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed methods, clearly demonstrating their superiority over TTD-free approaches in fortifying wideband PLS, as well as the advantageous secrecy energy efficiency achieved by leveraging low-cost analog devices.

0000-0002-2993-3467,Yuchen Zhang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Heterogeneous Subgraph Transformer for Fake News Detection,1970,"  Fake news is pervasive on social media, inflicting substantial harm on public discourse and societal well-being. We investigate the explicit structural information and textual features of news pieces by constructing a heterogeneous graph concerning the relations among news topics, entities, and content. Through our study, we reveal that fake news can be effectively detected in terms of the atypical heterogeneous subgraphs centered on them, which encapsulate the essential semantics and intricate relations between news elements. However, suffering from the heterogeneity, exploring such heterogeneous subgraphs remains an open problem. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a heterogeneous subgraph transformer (HeteroSGT) to exploit subgraphs in our constructed heterogeneous graph. In HeteroSGT, we first employ a pre-trained language model to derive both word-level and sentence-level semantics. Then the random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to extract subgraphs centered on each news, which are further fed to our proposed subgraph Transformer to quantify the authenticity. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HeteroSGT over five baselines. Further case and ablation studies validate our motivation and demonstrate that performance improvement stems from our specially designed components.

In this paper, we introduce PixelDance, a novel approach based on diffusion models that incorporates image instructions for both the first and last frames in conjunction with text instructions for video generation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that PixelDance trained with public data exhibits significantly better proficiency in synthesizing videos with complex scenes and intricate motions, setting a new standard for video generation.

We propose Boximator, a new approach for fine-grained motion control. Boximator introduces two constraint types: hard box and soft box. Users select objects in the conditional frame using hard boxes and then use either type of boxes to roughly or rigorously define the object's position, shape, or motion path in future frames. Boximator functions as a plug-in for existing video diffusion models. Its training process preserves the base model's knowledge by freezing the original weights and training only the control module. To address training challenges, we introduce a novel self-tracking technique that greatly simplifies the learning of box-object correlations. Empirically, Boximator achieves state-of-the-art video quality (FVD) scores, improving on two base models, and further enhanced after incorporating box constraints. Its robust motion controllability is validated by drastic increases in the bounding box alignment metric. Human evaluation also shows that users favor Boximator generation results over the base model.

0000-0002-2993-3467,Yuchen Zhang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Are AI-Generated Text Detectors Robust to Adversarial Perturbations?,1970,"  The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text. Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text. This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5\%-18.25\% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CarlanLark/Robust-AIGC-Detector}.

0000-0002-2993-3467,Yuchen Zhang,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",Navigating Complexity: Toward Lossless Graph Condensation via Expanding   Window Matching,1970,"  Graph condensation aims to reduce the size of a large-scale graph dataset by synthesizing a compact counterpart without sacrificing the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on it, which has shed light on reducing the computational cost for training GNNs. Nevertheless, existing methods often fall short of accurately replicating the original graph for certain datasets, thereby failing to achieve the objective of lossless condensation. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the potential reasons and reveal that the previous state-of-the-art trajectory matching method provides biased and restricted supervision signals from the original graph when optimizing the condensed one. This significantly limits both the scale and efficacy of the condensed graph. In this paper, we make the first attempt toward \textit{lossless graph condensation} by bridging the previously neglected supervision signals. Specifically, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to train expert trajectories with more diverse supervision signals from the original graph, and then effectively transfer the information into the condensed graph with expanding window matching. Moreover, we design a loss function to further extract knowledge from the expert trajectories.

Many deep learning models have been proposed to embed DNA sequences and predict their enzymatic function, leveraging information in public databases linking DNA sequences to an enzymatic function label. However, much of the scientific community's knowledge of biological function is not represented in these categorical labels, and is instead captured in unstructured text descriptions of mechanisms, reactions, and enzyme behavior. These descriptions are often captured alongside DNA sequences in biological databases, albeit in an unstructured manner. Deep learning of models predicting enzymatic function are likely to benefit from incorporating this multi-modal data encoding scientific knowledge of biological function. There is, however, no dataset designed for machine learning algorithms to leverage this multi-modal information. Here we propose a novel dataset and benchmark suite that enables the exploration and development of large multi-modal neural network models on gene DNA sequences and natural language descriptions of gene function.

In this paper, we present a uniform \emph{Chandra} X-ray data analysis of a sample of 152 $z\geq4.5$ quasars. We firmly detect 46 quasars of this sample in 0.5-2~keV above 3~$\sigma$ and calculate the upper limits of the X-ray flux of the remaining. We also estimate the power law photon index of the X-ray spectrum of 31 quasars. 24 of our sample quasars are detected in the FIRST or NVSS radio surveys; all of them are radio-loud. We statistically compare the X-ray properties of our $z\geq4.5$ quasars to other X-ray samples of AGN at different redshifts. The relation between the rest-frame X-ray luminosity and other quasar parameters, such as the bolometric luminosity, UV luminosity, or SMBH mass, show large scatters. These large scatters can be attributed to the narrow luminosity range at the highest redshift, the large measurement error based on relatively poor X-ray data, and the inclusion of radio-loud quasars in the sample. The $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$ relationship is significantly sub-linear. We do not find a significant redshift evolution of the $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$ relation, expressed either in the slope of this relation, or the departure of individual AGNs from the best-fit $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\rm UV}$ relation ($\Delta\alpha_{\rm OX}$). The median value of the X-ray photon index is $\Gamma\approx1.79$, which does not show redshift evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim7$. The X-ray and UV properties of the most distant quasars could potentially be used as a standard candle to constrain cosmological models. The large scatter of our sample on the Hubble diagram highlights the importance of future large unbiased deep X-ray and radio surveys in using quasars in cosmological studies.

Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold:   (1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in the paper.

Using the previously unobserved \tripletS series, we demonstrate trapped Rydberg atom lifetimes exceeding $100\,\mu$s, and observe no evidence of auto- or photo-ionization from the trap light for these states. We measure a coherence time of $T_2 = 59$ $\mu$s between two Rydberg levels, exceeding the 28 $\mu$s lifetime of untrapped Rydberg atoms under the same conditions. These results are promising for extending the interaction time of Rydberg atom arrays for quantum simulation and computing, and are vital to capitalize on the extended Rydberg lifetimes in circular states or cryogenic environments.

The systems are based on the 1st-place system of DCASE 2019 Task 4, which adopts weakly-supervised framework with an attention-based embedding-level pooling module and a semi-supervised learning approach named guided learning. This year, we incorporate multi-branch learning (MBL) into the original system to further improve its performance. MBL uses different branches with different pooling strategies (including instance-level and embedding-level strategies) and different pooling modules (including attention pooling, global max pooling or global average pooling modules), which share the same feature encoder of the model. Therefore, multiple branches pursuing different purposes and focusing on different characteristics of the data can help the feature encoder model the feature space better and avoid over-fitting. To better exploit the strongly-labeled synthetic data, inspired by multi-task learning, we also employ a sound event detection branch. To combine sound separation (SS) with sound event detection (SED), we fuse the results of SED systems with SS-SED systems which are trained using separated sound output by an SS system. The experimental results prove that MBL can improve the model performance and using SS has great potential to improve the performance of SED ensemble system.

The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F\""orster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in $^{171}$Yb using $F=3/2$ Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable $F=1/2$ state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of $\mathcal{F}=0.994(1)$, with the remaining error fully explained by known sources.

To address the computational challenge of drawing numerous samples requiring expensive PDE solves from the posterior distribution, we integrate an adaptive and goal-oriented model reduction technique with an optimization-based Stein variational gradient descent method (SVGD). The samples are drawn from the prior distribution and iteratively pushed to the posterior by a sequence of transport maps, which are constructed by SVGD, requiring the evaluation of the potential---the negative log of the likelihood function---and its gradient with respect to the random parameters, which depend on the solution of the PDE. To reduce the computational cost, we develop an adaptive and goal-oriented model reduction technique based on reduced basis approximations for the evaluation of the potential and its gradient. We present a detailed analysis for the reduced basis approximation errors of the potential and its gradient, the induced errors of the posterior distribution measured by Kullback--Leibler divergence, as well as the errors of the samples. To demonstrate the computational accuracy and efficiency of SVRB, we report results of numerical experiments on a Bayesian inverse problem governed by a diffusion PDE with random parameters with both uniform and Gaussian prior distributions. Over 100X speedups can be achieved while the accuracy of the approximation of the potential and its gradient is preserved.

In this work, by solving the Boltzmann transport equation based on first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the phonon transport properties of topological semimetal WC and WN. The predicted room-temperature lattice thermal conductivities of WC (WN) along a and c directions are 1140.64 (7.47) $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ and 1214.69 (5.39) $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$. Considering the similar crystal structure of WC and WN, it is quite interesting to find that the thermal conductivity of WC is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of WN. It is found that, different from WN, the large acoustic-optical (a-o) gap prohibits the acoustic+acoustic$\rightarrow$optical (aao) scattering, which gives rise to very long phonon lifetimes, leading to ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity in WC. For WN, the lack of a-o gap is due to soft phonon modes in optical branches, which can provide more scattering channels for aao scattering, producing very short phonon lifetimes. Further deep insight can be attained from their different electronic structures. Distinctly different from that in WC, the density of states (DOS) of WN at the Fermi level becomes very sharp, which leads to destabilization of WN, producing soft phonon modes. It is found that the small shear modulus $G$ and $C_{44}$ limit the stability of WN, compared with WC. Our works provide valuable information for phonon transports in WC and WN, and motivate further experimental works to study their lattice thermal conductivities.

0000-0001-6122-0574,Peng Chen,"Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology",FATNN: Fast and Accurate Ternary Neural Networks,1970,"  Ternary Neural Networks (TNNs) have received much attention due to being potentially orders of magnitude faster in inference, as well as more power efficient, than full-precision counterparts. However, 2 bits are required to encode the ternary representation with only 3 quantization levels leveraged. As a result, conventional TNNs have similar memory consumption and speed compared with the standard 2-bit models, but have worse representational capability. Moreover, there is still a significant gap in accuracy between TNNs and full-precision networks, hampering their deployment to real applications. To tackle these two challenges, in this work, we first show that, under some mild constraints, computational complexity of the ternary inner product can be reduced by a factor of 2. Second, to mitigate the performance gap, we elaborately design an implementation-dependent ternary quantization algorithm. The proposed framework is termed Fast and Accurate Ternary Neural Networks (FATNN). Experiments on image classification demonstrate that our FATNN surpasses the state-of-the-arts by a significant margin in accuracy. More importantly, speedup evaluation compared with various precisions is analyzed on several platforms, which serves as a strong benchmark for further research.

Gravitational-wave parameter estimation lies within the class of multifidelity problems, where a variety of models with differing assumptions, levels of fidelity, and computational cost are available for use in inference. In an effort to accelerate the solution of a Bayesian inverse problem, cheaper surrogates for the best models may be used to reduce the cost of likelihood evaluations when sampling the posterior. Importance sampling can then be used to reweight these samples to represent the true target posterior, incurring a reduction in the effective sample size. In cases when the problem is high dimensional, or when the surrogate model produces a poor approximation of the true posterior, this reduction in effective samples can be dramatic and render multifidelity importance sampling ineffective. We propose a novel method of tempered multifidelity importance sampling in order to remedy this issue. With this method the biasing distribution produced by the low-fidelity model is tempered, allowing for potentially better overlap with the target distribution. There is an optimal temperature which maximizes the efficiency in this setting, and we propose a low-cost strategy for approximating this optimal temperature using samples from the untempered distribution. In this paper, we motivate this method by applying it to Gaussian target and biasing distributions. Finally, we apply it to a series of problems in gravitational wave parameter estimation and demonstrate improved efficiencies when applying the method to real gravitational wave detections.

Facial animations play a crucial role as they effectively convey emotions and attitudes of virtual humans. However, creating such facial animations can be challenging, as current methods often involve utilization of expensive motion capture devices or significant investments of time and effort from human animators in tuning animation parameters. In this paper, we propose a holistic solution to automatically animate virtual human faces. In our solution, a deep learning model was first trained to retarget the facial expression from input face images to virtual human faces by estimating the blendshape coefficients. This method offers the flexibility of generating animations with characters of different appearances and blendshape topologies. Second, a practical toolkit was developed using Unity 3D, making it compatible with the most popular VR applications. The toolkit accepts both image and video as input to animate the target virtual human faces and enables users to manipulate the animation results. Furthermore, inspired by the spirit of Human-in-the-loop (HITL), we leveraged user feedback to further improve the performance of the model and toolkit, thereby increasing the customization properties to suit user preferences. The whole solution, for which we will make the code public, has the potential to accelerate the generation of facial animations for use in VR applications.

We study the boundedness of the Riesz transform $d\Delta ^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ on both Hardy spaces $H^p$ and Lebesgue spaces $L^p$ under two different conditions on the negative part of the Ricci curvature $R^-$.   First we prove that if $R^-$ is $\alpha$-subcritical for some $\alpha \in [0,1)$, then the Riesz transform $d^*\Delta^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ on differential $1$-forms is bounded from the associated Hardy space $H^p_{\overrightarrow{\Delta}}(\Lambda^1T^*M)$ to $L^p(M)$ for all $p\in [1,2]$.   As a consequence, the Riesz transform (on functions) is bounded on $ L^p$ for all $p\in (1,p_0)$ where $p_0>2$ depends on $\alpha$ and the constant appearing in the doubling property. Second, we prove that if $$\int_0^1 \left\|\frac{|R^-|^{\frac{1}{2}}}{v(\cdot,\ \sqrt{t})^{\frac{1}{p_1}}}\right\|_{p_1}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{t}}+\int_1^\infty \left\|\frac{|R^-|^{\frac{1}{2}}}{v(\cdot,\ \sqrt{t})^{\frac{1}{p_2}}}\right\|_{p_2}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{t}}<\infty,$$ for some $p_1>2$ and $p_2>3$, then the Riesz transform $d\Delta^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is bounded on $L^p$ for all $1<p<p_2$.

For a given TF the ensemble starts with position weight matrices (PWM's) for the motif, collected from the component algorithms. Using dimension reduction, we identify significant PWM-based subspaces for analysis. Within each subspace a machine classifier is built for identifying the TF's gene (promoter) targets (Problem 1). These PWM-based subspaces form an ML-based sequence analysis tool. Problem 2 (finding binding motifs) is solved by agglomerating k-mer (string) feature PWM-based subspaces that stand out in identifying gene targets. We approach Problem 3 (binding sites) with a novel machine learning approach that uses promoter string features and ML importance scores in a classification algorithm locating binding sites across the genome. For target gene identification this method improves performance (measured by the F1 score) by about 10 percentage points over the (a) motif scanning method and (b) the coexpression-based association method.

For identifying individual binding sites on a benchmark cross species database (Tompa et al., 2005) we match the best performer without much human intervention. It also improved the performance on mammalian TFs.   The ensemble can integrate orthogonal information from different weak learners (potentially using entirely different types of features) into a machine learner that can perform consistently better for more TFs.

Unlike existing methods, we design a versatile projection approach that maps various 2D semantic features from pre-trained image encoders into a novel semantic component of 3D Gaussians, which is based on spatial relationship and need no additional training. We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predicts the semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. The quantitative results on ScanNet segmentation and LERF object localization demonstates the superior performance of our method. Additionally, we explore several applications of Semantic Gaussians including object part segmentation, instance segmentation, scene editing, and spatiotemporal segmentation with better qualitative results over 2D and 3D baselines, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness on supporting diverse downstream tasks.

However, with state-of-the-art PVMs growing to billions or even trillions of parameters, the standard full fine-tuning paradigm is becoming unsustainable due to high computational and storage demands. In response, researchers are exploring parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which seeks to exceed the performance of full fine-tuning with minimal parameter modifications. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and future directions for visual PEFT, offering a systematic review of the latest advancements. First, we provide a formal definition of PEFT and discuss model pre-training methods. We then categorize existing methods into three categories: addition-based, partial-based, and unified-based.

While there exist extensive studies to ascertain the important structural aspects governing their mechanical behaviors, elucidating the underlying deformation mechanisms still remains a challenge. Using atomistic simulations, we probe the particle rearrangements in a yielding, model HEA system to understand the structural origin of its plasticity. We find the plastic deformation is initiated by irreversible topological fluctuations which tend to spatially localize in regions termed as soft spots which consist of particles actively participating in slow vibrational motions, an observation strikingly reminiscent of nonlinear glassy rheology. Due to the varying local elastic moduli resulting from the loss of compositional periodicity, these plastic responses exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity and are found to be inversely correlated with the distribution of local electronegativity. Further mechanical loading promotes the cooperativity among these local plastic events and triggers the formation of dislocation loops. As in strained crystalline solids, different dislocation loops can further merge together and propagate as the main carrier of large-scale plastic deformation. However, the energy barriers located at the spatial regions with higher local electronegativity severely hinders the motion of dislocations. By delineating the transient mechanical response in terms of atomic configuration, our computational findings shed new light on understanding the nature of plasticity of single-phase HEA.

While standard SSL assumes uniform data distribution, we consider a more realistic and challenging setting called imbalanced SSL, where imbalanced class distributions occur in both labeled and unlabeled data. Although there are existing endeavors to tackle this challenge, their performance degenerates when facing severe imbalance since they can not reduce the class imbalance sufficiently and effectively. In this paper, we study a simple yet overlooked baseline -- SimiS -- which tackles data imbalance by simply supplementing labeled data with pseudo-labels, according to the difference in class distribution from the most frequent class. Such a simple baseline turns out to be highly effective in reducing class imbalance. It outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, e.g., 12.8%, 13.6%, and 16.7% over previous SOTA on CIFAR100-LT, FOOD101-LT, and ImageNet127 respectively. The reduced imbalance results in faster convergence and better pseudo-label accuracy of SimiS. The simplicity of our method also makes it possible to be combined with other re-balancing techniques to improve the performance further. Moreover, our method shows great robustness to a wide range of data distributions, which holds enormous potential in practice. Code will be publicly available.

We evaluate ChatGPT's performance in news recommendation by eliciting direct responses through the formulation of these two tasks. More importantly, we unravel the pivotal role of fine-tuning data quality in enhancing ChatGPT's personalized recommendation capabilities, and illustrates its potential in addressing the longstanding challenge of the ""cold item"" problem in RS. Our experiments, conducted using the Microsoft News dataset (MIND), reveal significant improvements achieved by ChatGPT after fine-tuning, especially in scenarios where a user's topic interests remain consistent, treating news RS as a ranking task.

To address these challenges, there is a growing need for automated fake news detection mechanisms. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, prompting exploration into their potential for verifying news claims. Instead of employing LLMs in a non-agentic way, where LLMs generate responses based on direct prompts in a single shot, our work introduces FactAgent, an agentic approach of utilizing LLMs for fake news detection. FactAgent enables LLMs to emulate human expert behavior in verifying news claims without any model training, following a structured workflow. This workflow breaks down the complex task of news veracity checking into multiple sub-steps, where LLMs complete simple tasks using their internal knowledge or external tools. At the final step of the workflow, LLMs integrate all findings throughout the workflow to determine the news claim's veracity. Compared to manual human verification, FactAgent offers enhanced efficiency. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FactAgent in verifying claims without the need for any training process. Moreover, FactAgent provides transparent explanations at each step of the workflow and during final decision-making, offering insights into the reasoning process of fake news detection for end users. FactAgent is highly adaptable, allowing for straightforward updates to its tools that LLMs can leverage within the workflow, as well as updates to the workflow itself using domain knowledge.

A major portion of SPH computation time is dedicated to the Nearest Neighboring Particle Search (NNPS) process. While advanced NNPS algorithms have been developed to enhance SPH efficiency, the potential efficiency gains from modern computation hardware remain underexplored. This study investigates the impact of GPU parallel architecture, low-precision computing on GPUs, and GPU memory management on NNPS efficiency. Our approach employs a GPU-accelerated mixed-precision SPH framework, utilizing low-precision float-point 16 (FP16) for NNPS while maintaining high precision for other components. To ensure FP16 accuracy in NNPS, we introduce a Relative Coordinated-based Link List (RCLL) algorithm, storing FP16 relative coordinates of particles within background cells. Our testing results show three significant speedup rounds for CPU-based NNPS algorithms. The first comes from parallel GPU computations, with up to a 1000x efficiency gain. The second is achieved through low-precision GPU computing, where the proposed FP16-based RCLL algorithm offers a 1.5x efficiency improvement over the FP64-based approach on GPUs. By optimizing GPU memory bandwidth utilization, the efficiency of the FP16 RCLL algorithm can be further boosted by 2.7x, as demonstrated in an example with 1 million particles.

It is a pivotal step for integrating KGs to increase knowledge coverage and quality. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of EA frameworks. However, state-of-the-art solutions tend to rely on labeled data for model training. Additionally, they work under the closed-domain setting and cannot deal with entities that are unmatchable. To address these deficiencies, we offer an unsupervised framework that performs entity alignment in the open world. Specifically, we first mine useful features from the side information of KGs. Then, we devise an unmatchable entity prediction module to filter out unmatchable entities and produce preliminary alignment results. These preliminary results are regarded as the pseudo-labeled data and forwarded to the progressive learning framework to generate structural representations, which are integrated with the side information to provide a more comprehensive view for alignment. Finally, the progressive learning framework gradually improves the quality of structural embeddings and enhances the alignment performance by enriching the pseudo-labeled data with alignment results from the previous round. Our solution does not require labeled data and can effectively filter out unmatchable entities. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate its superiority.

However, due to privacy regulations, accessing previous data and annotations can be problematic in the medical domain. This poses a significant barrier to preserving the high segmentation accuracy of the old classes when learning from new classes because of the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that simply using high-quality pseudo labels can fairly mitigate this problem in the setting of organ segmentation. Furthermore, we put forward an innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor segmentation, which incurs minimal computational overhead. Our proposed design involves replacing the conventional output layer with a suite of lightweight, class-specific heads, thereby offering the flexibility to accommodate newly emerging classes. These heads enable independent predictions for newly introduced and previously learned classes, effectively minimizing the impact of new classes on old ones during the course of continual learning. We further propose incorporating Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings into the organ-specific heads. These embeddings encapsulate the semantic information of each class, informed by extensive image-text co-training.

Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue.

The star is an old and very metal-poor low-mass main-sequence turn-off star (age $\sim14.0$ Gyr and [Fe/H] $= -2.23$ dex) and has a total velocity of $559.01^{+135.07}_{-87.40}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the Galactic rest-frame and a heliocentric distance of $2.90^{+0.72}_{-0.48}$ kpc. The velocity of J1443+1453 is larger than the escape speed at its position, suggesting it a promising HVS candidate. By reconstructing its trajectory in the Galactic potential, we find that the orbit of J1443+1453 intersects closely with that of the Sgr dSph $37.8^{+4.6}_{-6.0}$ Myr ago, when the latter has its latest pericentric passage through the Milky Way. The encounter occurs at a distance $2.42^{+1.80}_{-0.77}$ kpc from the centre of Sgr dSph, smaller than the size of the Sgr dSph.

The generator, PyraNet, is a novel Deep Learning network that implements 28 classic ResNet blocks in pyramid-like concatenations. The discriminator is a customized 4-layer DenseNet. The AI agent first generates customized 2D projections at 9 template beam angles from 3D CT volume and structures of a patient.

Finally, the predicted fluence maps are imported into a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) for plan integrity checks. The AI agent was built and tested upon 231 oropharyngeal plans from a TPS plan library. Only the primary plans in the sequential boost regime were studied. A customized Harr wavelet loss was adopted for fluence map comparison. Isodose distributions in test AI plans and TPS plans were qualitatively evaluated. Key dosimetric metrics were statistically compared.$$$$   Results: All test AI plans were successfully generated. Isodose gradients outside of PTV in AI plans were comparable with TPS plans. After PTV coverage normalization, $D_{mean}$ of parotids and oral cavity in AI plans and TPS plans were comparable without statistical significance. AI plans achieved comparable $D_{max}$ at 0.01cc of brainstem and cord+5mm without clinically relevant differences, but body $D_{max}$ was higher than the TPS plan results.

The loss function consists in minimizing the distance between the prediction and the annotation of two key points that are representing the annotation of the object. The first point is the center point and the second is the head of the object. However, for the second point, the minimum distance between the prediction and either the head or tail of the groundtruth is used. On this way, either prediction is valid (with the head pointing to the tail or the tail pointing to the head). At the end the importance is to detect the direction of the object but not its heading. The new loss function has been evaluated on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets and has shown potential for elongated objects such as ships and also for other types of objects with different shapes.

A necessary condition is put forward for the group delay to be negative. It is shown that this negative group delay is closely related to its anomalous dependence on the width of the potential well. In order to demonstrate the validity of stationary-phase approach, numerical simulations are made for Gaussian-shaped temporal wave packets. A restriction to the potential-well's width is obtained that is necessary for the wave packet to remain distortionless in the travelling. Numerical comparison shows that the relativistic group delay is larger than its corresponding non-relativistic one.

This study proposes a localization correction method based on convolution neural network (CNN), which extracts obstacle features from maps to predict the localization errors caused by NLOS effects. A novel compensation scheme is developed and structured around the localization error in terms of distance and azimuth angle predicted by the CNN. Four prediction tasks are executed over different building distributions within the maps for typical urban scenario, resulting in CNN models with high prediction accuracy. Finally, a thorough comparison of the accuracy performance between the time difference of arrival (TDOA) localization algorithm and the results after the error compensation reveals that, generally, the CNN prediction approach demonstrates great localization error correction performance, improving TDOA accuracy by 75%. It can be observed that the powerful feature extraction capability of CNN can be exploited by processing surrounding maps to predict the localization error distribution, showing great potential for further enhancement of TDOA performance under challenging scenarios with rich multipath propagation.

This paper introduces novel {\em doubly nonparametric random utility models} that eschew traditional parametric assumptions used in estimating consumer demand's mean utility function and noise distribution. Existing nonparametric methods like multi-scale {\em Distributional Nearest Neighbors (DNN and TDNN)}, initially designed for offline regression, face challenges in dynamic online pricing due to design limitations, such as the indirect observability of utility-related variables and the absence of uniform convergence guarantees. We address these challenges with innovative population equations that facilitate nonparametric estimation within decision-making frameworks and establish new analytical results on the uniform convergence rates of DNN and TDNN, enhancing their applicability in dynamic environments.   Our theoretical analysis confirms that the statistical learning rates for the mean utility function and noise distribution are minimax optimal. We also derive a regret bound that illustrates the critical interaction between model dimensionality and noise distribution smoothness, deepening our understanding of dynamic pricing under varied market conditions. These contributions offer substantial theoretical insights and practical tools for implementing effective, data-driven pricing strategies, advancing the theoretical framework of pricing models and providing robust methodologies for navigating the complexities of modern markets.

In the case of potential-well traveling that is classically allowed, each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a subluminal time. When the thickness of the well is much smaller in comparision with a characteristic length of the incident wave packet, the reshaped wave packet in transmission maintains the profile of the incident wave packet. In the case of potential-barrier tunneling that is classically forbidden, though each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a time that is independent of the barrier thickness, the interference between multiple transmitted constituents explains the barrier-thickness dependence of the traversal time for thin barriers and its barrier-thickness independence for thick barriers. This manifests the nature of Hartman effect. ",https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/82/30009,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0D013600>,Yes,potent(4)

The close association between class I methanol masers and EGOs therefore provides a large catalogue of candidate sources, most of which have not previously been searched for class I methanol masers.

In the ""transitionless tracking algorithm"" proposed by Berry, shortcut Hamiltonians are designed so that the system follows exactly, in an arbitrarily short time, the approximate adiabatic path defined by a reference Hamiltonian. A different approach is based on designing first a Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant to carry the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian from specified initial to final configurations, again in an arbitrary time, and then constructing from the invariant the transient Hamiltonian connecting these boundary configurations. We show that the two approaches, apparently quite different in form and so far in results, are in fact strongly related and potentially equivalent, so that the inverse-engineering operations in one of them can be reinterpreted and understood in terms of the concepts and operations of the other one.

Blood samples have long been used as a health status indicator, but DNA methylation signatures in blood have not been fully appreciated in cancer research. Historically, analysis of cancer has been conducted directly with the patient's tumor or related tissues. Such analyses allow physicians to diagnose a patient's health and cancer status; however, physicians must observe certain symptoms that prompt them to use biopsies or imaging to verify the diagnosis. This is a post-hoc approach. Our study will focus on epigenetic information for cancer detection, specifically information about DNA methylation in human peripheral blood samples in cancer discordant monozygotic twin-pairs. This information might be able to help us detect cancer much earlier, before the first symptom appears. Several other types of epigenetic data can also be used, but here we demonstrate the potential of blood DNA methylation data as a biomarker for pan-cancer using SAS 9.3 and SAS EM.

A Lie group   theory,1970,"  First principle based prediction of mean flow quantities of wall-bounded turbulent flows (channel, pipe, and turbulent boundary layer - TBL) is of great importance from both physics and engineering standpoints. Here (Part I), we present a symmetry-based approach which derives analytic expressions governing the mean velocity profile (MVP) from an innovative Lie-group analysis. The new approach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e.g. stress length, shear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's mean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations (e.g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy a dilation group invariance - representing the effects of the wall on fluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant solutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of the order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous studies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified central `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a defect power law of form $1-r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center line) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and dissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the stress length function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between adjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer formula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important parameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All three kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in combination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS).

To manage these constraints and smooth out the expenditure across auctions, the bidders (or the platform on behalf of them) often employ pacing: each bidder is assigned a pacing multiplier between zero and one, and her bid on each item is multiplicatively scaled down by the pacing multiplier. This naturally gives rise to a game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier. The appropriate notion of equilibrium in this game is known as a pacing equilibrium. In this work, we show that the problem of finding an approximate pacing equilibrium is PPAD-complete for second-price auctions. This resolves an open question of Conitzer et al. [2021]. As a consequence of our hardness result, we show that the tatonnement-style budget-management dynamics introduced by Borgs et al.

Unlike traditional machine learning literature on this topic, our work places emphasis on statistical inference for the parameter estimates computed using reinforcement learning algorithms. While most existing analyses assume random rewards to follow standard distributions, limiting their applicability, we embrace the concept of robust statistics in reinforcement learning by simultaneously addressing issues of outlier contamination and heavy-tailed rewards within a unified framework. In this paper, we develop an online robust policy evaluation procedure, and establish the limiting distribution of our estimator, based on its Bahadur representation. Furthermore, we develop a fully-online procedure to efficiently conduct statistical inference based on the asymptotic distribution. This paper bridges the gap between robust statistics and statistical inference in reinforcement learning, offering a more versatile and reliable approach to policy evaluation. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical experiments conducted in real-world reinforcement learning experiments.

This paper first revisits the prevalent evaluation method-multiple choice question answering (MCQA), which allows for straightforward accuracy measurement. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 24 models across 11 benchmarks, we highlight several potential drawbacks of MCQA, for instance, the inconsistency between the MCQA evaluation and the generation of open-ended responses in practical scenarios. In response, we introduce an RWQ-Elo rating system, engaging 24 LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Google-Gemini-Pro and LLaMA-1/-2, in a two-player competitive format, with GPT-4 serving as the judge. Each LLM receives an Elo rating thereafter. This system is designed to mirror real-world usage, and for this purpose, we have compiled a new benchmark called ``Real-world questions'' (RWQ), comprising 20,772 authentic user inquiries. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the characteristics of our system and compare it with prior leaderboards like AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. Our analysis reveals the stability of our RWQ-Elo system, the feasibility of registering new models, and its potential to reshape LLM leaderboards.

However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.   In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.

Although several designs have shown superior power efficiency and performance compared to electrical alternatives, these networks will not scale to the thousands of cores required in the future.   In this paper, we introduce Hermes, a hybrid network composed of an optimized broadcast for power-efficient low-latency global-scale coordination and circuit-switch sub-networks for high-throughput data delivery. This network will scale for use in thousand core chip systems. At the physical level, SoI-based adiabatic coupler has been designed to provide low-loss and compact optical power splitting. Based on the adiabatic coupler, a topology based on 2-ary folded butterfly is designed to provide linear power division in a thousand core layout with minimal cross-overs. To address the network agility and provide for efficient use of optical bandwidth, a flow control and routing mechanism is introduced to dynamically allocate bandwidth and provide fairness usage of network resources. At the system level, bloom filter-based filtering for localization of communication are designed for reducing global traffic. In addition, a novel greedy-based data and workload migration are leveraged to increase the locality of communication in a NUCA (non-uniform cache access) architecture.

Since all the utility parameters of MNL are unknown, the seller needs to simultaneously learn customers' choice behavior and make dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current knowledge. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or equivalently, to minimize the expected regret. Although dynamic assortment planning problem has received an increasing attention in revenue management, most existing policies require the estimation of mean utility for each product and the final regret usually involves the number of products $N$. The optimal regret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and popular choice model---MNL model is still open. By carefully analyzing a revenue potential function, we develop a trisection based policy combined with adaptive confidence bound construction, which achieves an {item-independent} regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the length of selling horizon. We further establish the matching lower bound result to show the optimality of our policy. There are two major advantages of the proposed policy. First, the regret of all our policies has no dependence on $N$. Second, our policies are almost assumption free: there is no assumption on mean utility nor any ""separability"" condition on the expected revenues for different assortments. Our result also extends the unimodal bandit literature. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0EF93330>,Yes,potent(1)

In our approach, the divergence-free constraint for the viscous stress term is not enforced ahead of discretization. Instead, our formulation allows the scheme itself to ""choose"" a consistent way to interpret the divergence-free constraint: i.e., the divergence-free constraint is interpreted (or enforced) in a consistent fashion in both the mass conservation equation and the stress tensor term (in the momentum equation). Furthermore, our approach preserves the original symmetrical properties of the stress tensor, e.g. its rotational invariance, and it remains physically correct in the context of compressible flows. As a result, our approach facilitates versatility and code reuse. In this paper, we introduce our approach and establish some important mathematical properties for the resulting class of finite element schemes. More precisely, for general mixed methods, which are not necessarily pointwise divergence-free, we establish the existence of a new norm induced by the full, viscous bilinear form. Thereafter, we prove the coercivity of the viscous bilinear form and the semi-coercivity of a convective trilinear form. In addition, we demonstrate L2-stability of the discrete velocity fields for the general class of methods and (by deduction) the H(div)-conforming methods. Finally, we run some numerical experiments to illustrate the behavior of the versatile mixed methods, and we make careful comparisons with a conventional H(div)-conforming scheme.

When involving personalized information, how to protect the privacy of such information becomes a critical issue in practice. In this paper, we consider a dynamic pricing problem over $T$ time periods with an \emph{unknown} demand function of posted price and personalized information. At each time $t$, the retailer observes an arriving customer's personal information and offers a price. The customer then makes the purchase decision, which will be utilized by the retailer to learn the underlying demand function. There is potentially a serious privacy concern during this process: a third party agent might infer the personalized information and purchase decisions from price changes from the pricing system. Using the fundamental framework of differential privacy from computer science, we develop a privacy-preserving dynamic pricing policy, which tries to maximize the retailer revenue while avoiding information leakage of individual customer's information and purchasing decisions. To this end, we first introduce a notion of \emph{anticipating} $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy that is tailored to dynamic pricing problem. Our policy achieves both the privacy guarantee and the performance guarantee in terms of regret. Roughly speaking, for $d$-dimensional personalized information, our algorithm achieves the expected regret at the order of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1} \sqrt{d^3 T})$, when the customers' information is adversarially chosen. For stochastic personalized information, the regret bound can be further improved to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2T} + \varepsilon^{-2} d^2)$ ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0EFB7740>,Yes,potent(1)

However, this leads to the growing concern of potential violation of privacy due to adversarial attack. To address the privacy issue, this paper studies a dynamic personalized pricing problem with \textit{unknown} nonparametric demand models under data privacy protection. Two concepts of data privacy, which have been widely applied in practices, are introduced: \textit{central differential privacy (CDP)} and \textit{local differential privacy (LDP)}, which is proved to be stronger than CDP in many cases. We develop two algorithms which make pricing decisions and learn the unknown demand on the fly, while satisfying the CDP and LDP gurantees respectively. In particular, for the algorithm with CDP guarantee, the regret is proved to be at most $\tilde O(T^{(d+2)/(d+4)}+\varepsilon^{-1}T^{d/(d+4)})$. Here, the parameter $T$ denotes the length of the time horizon, $d$ is the dimension of the personalized information vector, and the key parameter $\varepsilon>0$ measures the strength of privacy (smaller $\varepsilon$ indicates a stronger privacy protection). On the other hand, for the algorithm with LDP guarantee, its regret is proved to be at most $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-2/(d+2)}T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$, which is near-optimal as we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2/(d+2)}T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ for any algorithm with LDP guarantee.

For instance, in the retailing industry, ensuring a balanced consumption of resources from different suppliers enhances fairness and helps main a healthy channel relationship; in the cloud computing industry, resource-consumption balance helps increase customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs. Motivated by these practical needs, this paper studies the price-based network revenue management (NRM) problem with both demand learning and fair resource-consumption balancing. We introduce the regularized revenue, i.e., the total revenue with a balancing regularization, as our objective to incorporate fair resource-consumption balancing into the revenue maximization goal. We propose a primal-dual-type online policy with the Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) demand learning method to maximize the regularized revenue. We adopt several innovative techniques to make our algorithm a unified and computationally efficient framework for the continuous price set and a wide class of balancing regularizers. Our algorithm achieves a worst-case regret of $\widetilde O(N^{5/2}\sqrt{T})$, where $N$ denotes the number of products and $T$ denotes the number of time periods.

The demand model is assumed to be a high-dimensional generalized linear model (GLM), allowing for a feature vector in $\mathbb R^d$ that encodes products and consumer information. To achieve optimal revenue (i.e., least regret), the firm needs to learn and exploit the unknown GLMs while monitoring for potential change-points. To tackle such a problem, we first design a novel penalized likelihood-based online change-point detection algorithm for high-dimensional GLMs, which is the first algorithm in the change-point literature that achieves optimal minimax localization error rate for high-dimensional GLMs. A change-point detection assisted dynamic pricing (CPDP) policy is further proposed and achieves a near-optimal regret of order $O(s\sqrt{\Upsilon_T T}\log(Td))$, where $s$ is the sparsity level and $\Upsilon_T$ is the number of change-points. This regret is accompanied with a minimax lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of CPDP (up to logarithmic factors). In particular, the optimality with respect to $\Upsilon_T$ is seen for the first time in the dynamic pricing literature, and is achieved via a novel accelerated exploration mechanism. Extensive simulation experiments and a real data application on online lending illustrate the efficiency of the proposed policy and the importance and practical value of handling non-stationarity in dynamic pricing.

In this paper we propose a strategy called algorithm-oriented qubit mapping (AOQMAP) that aims to bridge the gap between exact and scalable mapping methods by utilizing the inherent structure of algorithms. While exact methods provide optimal solutions, they become intractable for large circuits. Scalable methods, like SWAP networks, offer fast solutions but lack optimality. AOQMAP bridges this gap by leveraging algorithmic features and their association with specific device substructures to achieve optimal and scalable solutions. The proposed strategy follows a two stage approach. First, it maps circuits to subtopologies to meet connectivity constraints. Second, it identifies the optimal qubits for execution using a cost function. Notably, AOQMAP provides both scalable and optimal solutions for variational quantum algorithms with fully connected two qubit interactions on common subtopologies including linear, T-, and H-shaped, minimizing circuit depth. Benchmarking experiments conducted on IBM quantum devices demonstrate significant reductions in gate count and circuit depth compared to Qiskit, Tket, and SWAP network. Specifically, AOQMAP achieves up to an 82% reduction in circuit depth and an average 138% increase in success probability. This scalable and algorithm-specific approach holds the potential to optimize a wider range of quantum algorithms.

Such UNN-based methods are appealing as they have the potential of avoiding the computationally intensive retraining required for different source models and different measurement scenarios. We first develop a theoretical framework for characterizing the performance of such UNN-based methods. The theoretical framework, on the one hand, enables us to optimize the parameters of data-modulating masks, and on the other hand, provides a fundamental connection between the number of data frames that can be recovered from a single measurement to the parameters of the untrained NN. We also employ the recently proposed bagged-deep-image-prior (bagged-DIP) idea to develop SCI Bagged Deep Video Prior (SCI-BDVP) algorithms that address the common challenges faced by standard UNN solutions.

Due to the linear Dirac dispersion, the transmission as the function of the frequency has a gap, thus the correspond reflection has a frequency or wavelength window for the perfect reflection, which is similar to the Bragg reflection in the one-dimensional photonic crystals. Near the DP, the associated GH shifts in the transmission and reflection can be changed from positive to negative with increasing the wavelength. These negative and positive shifts can also be enhanced by transmission resonances, when the frequency is far from that at the DP.

Despite their potential for impressive performance, obtaining real-world training data is expensive, and can be impractically difficult for some tasks. Sim-to-real transfer with domain randomization offers a potential workaround, but often requires extensive manual tuning and results in models that are brittle to distribution shift between sim and real. In this work, we introduce Composable Object Volume NeRF (COV-NeRF), an object-composable NeRF model that is the centerpiece of a real-to-sim pipeline for synthesizing training data targeted to scenes and objects from the real world. COV-NeRF extracts objects from real images and composes them into new scenes, generating photorealistic renderings and many types of 2D and 3D supervision, including depth maps, segmentation masks, and meshes. We show that COV-NeRF matches the rendering quality of modern NeRF methods, and can be used to rapidly close the sim-to-real gap across a variety of perceptual modalities.

Deep learning approaches have been used to enhance dMRI and predict diffusion biomarkers through undersampled dMRI. To generate more comprehensive raw dMRI, generative adversarial network based methods are proposed to include b-values and b-vectors as conditions, but they are limited by unstable training and less desirable diversity. The emerging diffusion model (DM) promises to improve generative performance. However, it remains challenging to include essential information in conditioning DM for more relevant generation, i.e., the physical principles of dMRI and white matter tract structures. In this study, we propose a physics-guided diffusion model to generate high-quality dMRI. Our model introduces the physical principles of dMRI in the noise evolution in the diffusion process and introduce a query-based conditional mapping within the difussion model. In addition, to enhance the anatomical fine detials of the generation, we introduce the XTRACT atlas as prior of white matter tracts by adopting an adapter technique. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance dMRI enhancement.

Yet, these progresses are largely confined to widely recognized subjects, which can be learned with relative ease through models' adequate shared prior knowledge. In contrast, logos, characterized by unique patterns and textual elements, are hard to establish shared knowledge within diffusion models, thus presenting a unique challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of logo insertion. Our goal is to insert logo identities into diffusion models and enable their seamless synthesis in varied contexts. We present a novel two-phase pipeline LogoSticker to tackle this task. First, we propose the actor-critic relation pre-training algorithm, which addresses the nontrivial gaps in models' understanding of the potential spatial positioning of logos and interactions with other objects. Second, we propose a decoupled identity learning algorithm, which enables precise localization and identity extraction of logos. LogoSticker can generate logos accurately and harmoniously in diverse contexts. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of LogoSticker over customization methods and large models such as DALLE~3. \href{https://mingkangz.github.io/logosticker}{Project page}.

Due to the limited photon numbers and the non-ideal detector response of each energy channel, the reconstructed images usually contain much noise. With the development of Deep Learning (DL) technique, different kinds of DL-based models have been proposed for noise reduction. However, most of the models require clean data set as the training labels, which are not always available in medical imaging field. Inspiring by the similarities of each channel's reconstructed image, we proposed a self-supervised learning based PCCT image enhancement framework via multi-spectral channels (S2MS). In S2MS framework, both the input and output labels are noisy images. Specifically, one single channel image was used as output while images of other single channels and channel-sum image were used as input to train the network, which can fully use the spectral data information without extra cost. The simulation results based on the AAPM Low-dose CT Challenge database showed that the proposed S2MS model can suppress the noise and preserve details more effectively in comparison with the traditional DL models, which has potential to improve the image quality of PCCT in clinical applications.

Because of the substantial differences in object distribution and point density within point clouds collected from various environments, coupled with the intricate nature of 3D metrics, there is still a lack of a unified network architecture that can accommodate diverse scenes. In this paper, we propose Uni3DETR, a unified 3D detector that addresses indoor and outdoor 3D detection within the same framework. Specifically, we employ the detection transformer with point-voxel interaction for object prediction, which leverages voxel features and points for cross-attention and behaves resistant to the discrepancies from data. We then propose the mixture of query points, which sufficiently exploits global information for dense small-range indoor scenes and local information for large-range sparse outdoor ones. Furthermore, our proposed decoupled IoU provides an easy-to-optimize training target for localization by disentangling the xy and z space. Extensive experiments validate that Uni3DETR exhibits excellent performance consistently on both indoor and outdoor 3D detection. In contrast to previous specialized detectors, which may perform well on some particular datasets but suffer a substantial degradation on different scenes, Uni3DETR demonstrates the strong generalization ability under heterogeneous conditions (Fig. 1).

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid analog-digital protocol designed for the nonadiabatic yet high-fidelity transfer of edge states in an SSH chain, featuring two sublattices, A and B. The core of our approach lies in harnessing the approximate time-dependent counterdiabatic (CD) interaction, derived from adiabatic gauge potentials. However, to enhance transfer fidelity, particularly in long-distance chains, higher-order nested commutators become crucial. To simplify the experimental implementation and navigate computational complexities, we identify the next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping terms between sublattice A sites as dominant CD driving and further optimize them by using variational quantum circuits. Through digital quantum simulation, our protocol showcases the capability to achieve rapid and robust solutions, even in the presence of disorder. This analog-digital transfer protocol, an extension of quantum control methodology, establishes a robust framework for edge-state transfer. Importantly, the optimal CD driving identified can be seamlessly implemented across various quantum registers, highlighting the versatility of our approach.

Implementing braiding in a classical system can assist the experimental investigation of non-Abelian physics. However, the design of non-Abelian gauge fields faces numerous challenges stemmed from the intricate interplay of group structures, Lie algebra properties, representation theory, topology, and symmetry breaking. The extreme diversity makes it a powerful tool for the study of condensed matter physics. Whereas the widely used artificial intelligence with data-driven approaches has greatly promoted the development of physics, most works are limited on the data-to-data design. Here we propose a self-reasoning assistant learning framework capable of directly generating non-Abelian gauge fields. This framework utilizes the forward diffusion process to capture and reproduce the complex patterns and details inherent in the target distribution through continuous transformation. Then the reverse diffusion process is used to make the generated data closer to the distribution of the original situation. Thus, it owns strong self-reasoning capabilities, allowing to automatically discover the feature representation and capture more subtle relationships from the dataset. Moreover, the self-reasoning eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and simplifies the process of model building. Our framework offers a disruptive paradigm shift to parse complex physical processes, automatically uncovering patterns from massive datasets.

0000-0002-3935-6480,Xi Chen,"Fudan University, Huashan Hospital Fudan University",Leverage Staking with Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): Opportunities   and Risks,1970,"  In the Proof of Stake (PoS) Ethereum ecosystem, users can stake ETH on Lido to receive stETH, a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) that represents staked ETH and accrues staking rewards. LSDs improve the liquidity of staked assets by facilitating their use in secondary markets, such as for collateralized borrowing on Aave or asset exchanges on Curve. The composability of Lido, Aave, and Curve enables an emerging strategy known as leverage staking, where users supply stETH as collateral on Aave to borrow ETH and then acquire more stETH. This can be done directly by initially staking ETH on Lido or indirectly by swapping ETH for stETH on Curve. While this iterative process enhances financial returns, it also introduces potential risks.   This paper explores the opportunities and risks of leverage staking. We establish a formal framework for leverage staking with stETH and identify 442 such positions on Ethereum over 963 days. These positions represent a total volume of 537,123 ETH (877m USD). Our data reveal that the majority (81.7%) of leverage staking positions achieved an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) higher than that of conventional staking on Lido. Despite the high returns, we also recognize the risks of leverage staking. From the Terra crash incident, we understand that token devaluation can greatly impact the market. Therefore, we conduct stress tests under extreme conditions, particularly during stETH devaluations, to thoroughly evaluate the associated risks. Our simulations indicate that leverage staking can exacerbate the risk of cascading liquidations by introducing additional selling pressures from liquidation and deleveraging activities. Moreover, this strategy poses broader systemic risks as it undermines the stability of ordinary positions by intensifying their liquidations.

However, existing prompt-based learning methods for knowledge graph construction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structured knowledge with pre-defined schema, which means model cannot fully exploit semantic knowledge with the constrained templates; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features, which are unable to unleash the potential analogical capability of pre-trained language models. Motivated by these observations, we propose a retrieval-augmented approach, which retrieves schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), for data-efficient knowledge graph construction. It can dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from human-annotated and weak-supervised data as a prompt for each sample, which is model-agnostic and can be plugged into widespread existing approaches.

To be specific, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of large-scale job posting data in BOSS Zhipin, the largest online recruitment platform in China. The results indicate that about 28% of occupations in the current labor market require ChatGPT-related skills. Furthermore, based on a large-scale occupation-centered knowledge graph, we develop a semantic information enhanced collaborative filtering algorithm to predict the future occupation-skill relations in the labor market. As a result, we find that additional 45% occupations in the future will require ChatGPT-related skills. In particular, industries related to technology, products, and operations are expected to have higher proficiency requirements for ChatGPT-related skills, while the manufacturing, services, education, and health science related industries will have lower requirements for ChatGPT-related skills.

To capture the dynamism and interdependencies of nodes, existing TIG embedding models need to process edges sequentially and chronologically. However, this requirement prevents it from being processed in parallel and struggle to accommodate burgeoning data volumes to GPU. Consequently, many large-scale temporal interaction graphs are confined to CPU processing. Furthermore, a generalized GPU scaling and acceleration approach remains unavailable. To facilitate large-scale TIGs' implementation on GPUs for acceleration, we introduce a novel training approach namely Streaming Edge Partitioning and Parallel Acceleration for Temporal Interaction Graph Embedding (SPEED). The SPEED is comprised of a Streaming Edge Partitioning Component (SEP) which addresses space overhead issue by assigning fewer nodes to each GPU, and a Parallel Acceleration Component (PAC) which enables simultaneous training of different sub-graphs, addressing time overhead issue. Our method can achieve a good balance in computing resources, computing time, and downstream task performance. Empirical validation across 7 real-world datasets demonstrates the potential to expedite training speeds by a factor of up to 19.29x. Simultaneously, resource consumption of a single-GPU can be diminished by up to 69%, thus enabling the multiple GPU-based training and acceleration encompassing millions of nodes and billions of edges. Furthermore, our approach also maintains its competitiveness in downstream tasks.

0000-0002-3935-6480,Xi Chen,"Fudan University, Huashan Hospital Fudan University",MEV Makes Everyone Happy under Greedy Sequencing Rule,1970,"  Trading through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has become crucial in today's blockchain ecosystem, enabling users to swap tokens efficiently and automatically. However, the capacity of miners to strategically order transactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks, sandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for their own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes recently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of transactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price. Utilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct sandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.   However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free profits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal strategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility of miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results unveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally strategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of trading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter represents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.   Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon: Miner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without trading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm, all users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent or surpass profits compared to their expectations. This outcome provides further support for the study and design of sequencing rules in decentralized exchanges.

This paper pioneers the investigation into the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing for LLMs. To achieve this, we introduce new benchmark datasets and propose innovative evaluation metrics. Our results underline two pivotal concerns: (1) Knowledge Conflict: Editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify the inherent inconsistencies in LLMs-a facet neglected by previous methods. (2) Knowledge Distortion: Altering parameters with the aim of editing factual knowledge can irrevocably warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs. Experimental results vividly demonstrate that knowledge editing might inadvertently cast a shadow of unintended consequences on LLMs, which warrant attention and efforts for future works.

Yet, assessing such news article frames remains a challenge due to the absence of a concrete and unified standard dataset that considers the comprehensive nuances within news content.   To address this gap, we introduce an extended version of a large labeled news article dataset with 16,687 new labeled pairs. Leveraging the pairwise comparison of news articles, our method frees the work of manual identification of frame classes in traditional news frame analysis studies. Overall we introduce the most extensive cross-lingual news article similarity dataset available to date with 26,555 labeled news article pairs across 10 languages. Each data point has been meticulously annotated according to a codebook detailing eight critical aspects of news content, under a human-in-the-loop framework. Application examples demonstrate its potential in unearthing country communities within global news coverage, exposing media bias among news outlets, and quantifying the factors related to news creation. We envision that this news similarity dataset will broaden our understanding of the media ecosystem in terms of news coverage of events and perspectives across countries, locations, languages, and other social constructs. By doing so, it can catalyze advancements in social science research and applied methodologies, thereby exerting a profound impact on our society.

Fictitious candidate resumes were created to control for identity factors while maintaining consistent qualifications. Three LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3-haiku, and Mistral-Large) were tested using a standardized prompt to evaluate resumes for specific residency programs. Explicit bias was tested by changing gender and race information, while implicit bias was tested by changing names while hiding race and gender. Physician data from the Association of American Medical Colleges was used to compare with real-world demographics. 900,000 resumes were evaluated. All LLMs exhibited significant gender and racial biases across medical specialties. Gender preferences varied, favoring male candidates in surgery and orthopedics, while preferring females in dermatology, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Claude-3 and Mistral-Large generally favored Asian candidates, while GPT-4 preferred Black and Hispanic candidates in several specialties. Tests revealed strong preferences towards Hispanic females and Asian males in various specialties. Compared to real-world data, LLMs consistently chose higher proportions of female and underrepresented racial candidates than their actual representation in the medical workforce. GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large showed significant gender and racial biases when evaluating medical professionals for residency selection. These findings highlight the potential for LLMs to perpetuate biases and compromise healthcare workforce diversity if used without proper bias mitigation strategies.

However, reducing the X-ray dose in CT scanning often leads to severe noise and artifacts in the reconstructed images, which might adversely affect diagnosis. By utilizing the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, statistical priors could be combined with artificial priors to improve LDCT reconstruction quality. However, conventional EM-based regularization methods adopt an alternating solving strategy, i.e. full reconstruction followed by image-regularization, resulting in over-smoothing and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose to integrate TV regularization into the ``M''-step of the EM algorithm, thus achieving effective and efficient regularization. Besides, by employing the Chambolle-Pock (CP) algorithm and the ordered subset (OS) strategy, we propose the OSEM-CP algorithm for LDCT reconstruction, in which both reconstruction and regularization are conducted view-by-view. Furthermore, by unrolling OSEM-CP, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction neural network (NN), named OSEM-CPNN, with remarkable performance and efficiency that achieves high-quality reconstructions in just one full-view iteration. Experiments on different models and datasets demonstrate our methods' outstanding performance compared to traditional and state-of-the-art deep-learning methods.

Usually, these algorithms need a carefully designed reward function to guide training in each time step. However, in real world, it is non-trivial to design such a reward function, and the only signal available is usually obtained at the end of a trajectory, also known as the episodic reward or return. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for temporal credit assignment, which learns to decompose the episodic return back to each time-step in the trajectory using deep neural networks. With this learned reward signal, the learning efficiency can be substantially improved for episodic reinforcement learning. In particular, we find that expressive language models such as the Transformer can be adopted for learning the importance and the dependency of states in the trajectory, therefore providing high-quality and interpretable learned reward signals. We have performed extensive experiments on a set of MuJoCo continuous locomotive control tasks with only episodic returns and demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm.

To uncover the transition of surface patterns, two dimensional plane strain simulations are performed on the defected bilayer subjected to uniaxial compression. Although the substrate is considered as the linear elastic material, the presence of defects can directly trigger the formation of locally ridged and then folding configurations from flat surface with a relatively small compressive strain. It is followed by the coexisting phases of folds and wrinkles under further overall compression. This phase transition reverses the traditional transition of wrinkle to ridge or fold for defect free substrates. It is also found that the onset of initial bifurcation is highly dependent on the spatial configuration and geometries of holes, since the interaction of defects allows more strain relief mechanisms beyond wrinkling. Furthermore, a rich diversity of periodic surface topologies, including overall waves, localizations, saw like and coexisting features of folds and wrinkles can be obtained by varying the diameter, depth and spacing of holes as well as compressive strain, which provides a potential approach to engineer various surface patterns for applications.

0000-0002-3935-6480,Xi Chen,"Fudan University, Huashan Hospital Fudan University",Autoregressive-Model-Based Methods for Online Time Series Prediction   with Missing Values: an Experimental Evaluation,1970,"  Time series prediction with missing values is an important problem of time series analysis since complete data is usually hard to obtain in many real-world applications. To model the generation of time series, autoregressive (AR) model is a basic and widely used one, which assumes that each observation in the time series is a noisy linear combination of some previous observations along with a constant shift. To tackle the problem of prediction with missing values, a number of methods were proposed based on various data models. For real application scenarios, how do these methods perform over different types of time series with different levels of data missing remains to be investigated. In this paper, we focus on online methods for AR-model-based time series prediction with missing values. We adapted five mainstream methods to fit in such a scenario. We make detailed discussion on each of them by introducing their core ideas about how to estimate the AR coefficients and their different strategies to deal with missing values. We also present algorithmic implementations for better understanding. In order to comprehensively evaluate these methods and do the comparison, we conduct experiments with various configurations of relative parameters over both synthetic and real data. From the experimental results, we derived several noteworthy conclusions and shows that imputation is a simple but reliable strategy to handle missing values in online prediction tasks.

While renewable energy-aware data centers have been proposed, these solutions have certain limitations. The primary limitation is due to the design of data centers which focus on large-size facilities located in selected locations. This paper addresses this problem, by utilizing in-network caching with each router having storage and being powered by renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Besides placing contents closer to end users, utilizing in-network caching could potentially increase probability of capturing renewable energy in diverse geographical locations. Our proposed solution is dual- layered: on the first layer a distributed gradient-based routing protocol is used to discover the paths along routers that are powered by the highest renewable energy, and on the second layer, a caching mechanism will pull the contents from the data centre and place them on routers of the paths that are discovered by our routing protocol. Through our experiments on a testbed utilizing real meteorological data, our proposed solution has demonstrated increased quantity of renewable energy consumption, while reducing the workload on the data centers.

Existing studies show the evolutionary behaviors of social communities can effectively be described using patterns including split, shrink, merge, expand, emerge, and extinct. However, existing pattern-based approaches are limited in supporting quantitative analysis, and are potentially problematic for using the patterns in a mutually exclusive manner when describing community evolution. In this work, we propose that different patterns can occur simultaneously between every pair of communities during the evolution, just in different degrees. Four entropy-based indices are devised to measure the degree of community split, shrink, merge, and expand, respectively, which can provide a comprehensive and quantitative measure of community evolution in DSNs. The indices have properties desirable to quantify community evolution including monotonicity, and bounded maximum and minimum values that correspond to meaningful cases. They can also be combined to describe more patterns such as community emerge and extinct. We conduct experiments with real-world OSS projects to evaluate the validity of the proposed indices. The results suggest the proposed indices can effectively capture community evolution, and are consistent with existing approaches in detecting evolution patterns in DSNs with an accuracy of 94.1\%. The results also show that the indices are useful in predicting OSS team productivity with an accuracy of 0.718. In summary, the proposed approach is among the first to quantify the degree of community evolution with respect to different patterns, which is promising in supporting future research and applications about DSNs and OSS development.

Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories, it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled. This challenge compromises the stability of policy gradients and negatively impacts sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned problems. Our framework offers a general approach allowing for a versatile selection of policy gradient methods to effectively and efficiently train SDEs.

It is difficult to directly measure the similarity between images and descriptions due to the modality heterogeneity (the cross-modal problem). And all samples belonging to a single category (the fine-grained problem) makes this task even harder than the conventional image-description matching task. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Image-text Alignments (MIA) model to alleviate the cross-modal fine-grained problem for better similarity evaluation in description-based person Re-id. Specifically, three different granularities, i.e., global-global, global-local and local-local alignments are carried out hierarchically. Firstly, the global-global alignment in the Global Contrast (GC) module is for matching the global contexts of images and descriptions. Secondly, the global-local alignment employs the potential relations between local components and global contexts to highlight the distinguishable components while eliminating the uninvolved ones adaptively in the Relation-guided Global-local Alignment (RGA) module. Thirdly, as for the local-local alignment, we match visual human parts with noun phrases in the Bi-directional Fine-grained Matching (BFM) module. The whole network combining multiple granularities can be end-to-end trained without complex pre-processing. To address the difficulties in training the combination of multiple granularities, an effective step training strategy is proposed to train these granularities step-by-step.

However, most of existing works only rely on either RoIs or connectivities, neglecting the potential for complementary information between them. To address this issue, we study how to discover the rich cross-view information in fMRI data of human brain. This paper presents a novel method for cross-view analysis of fMRI data of the human brain, called Cross-view transFormers (CvFormer). CvFormer employs RoI and connectivity encoder modules to generate two separate views of the human brain, represented as RoI and sub-connectivity tokens. Then, basic transformer modules can be used to process the RoI and sub-connectivity tokens, and cross-view modules integrate the complement information across two views. Furthermore, CvFormer uses a global token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches in cross-view modules, which only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time. To enhance the robustness of the proposed CvFormer, we propose a two-stage strategy to train its parameters. To be specific, RoI and connectivity views can be firstly utilized as self-supervised information to pre-train the CvFormer by combining it with contrastive learning and then fused to finetune the CvFormer using label information. Experiment results on two public ABIDE and ADNI datasets can show clear improvements by the proposed CvFormer, which can validate its effectiveness and superiority.

The advertising and associated online industries in particular have fuelled a rapid rise the in deployment of personal data collection and analytics tools. Traditionally, behavioural analytics relies on collecting vast amounts of data in centralised cloud infrastructure before using it to train machine learning models that allow user behaviour and preferences to be inferred. A contrasting approach, distributed data analytics, where code and models for training and inference are distributed to the places where data is collected, has been boosted by two recent, ongoing developments: increased processing power and memory capacity available in user devices at the edge of the network, such as smartphones and home assistants; and increased sensitivity to the highly intrusive nature of many of these devices and services and the attendant demands for improved privacy. Indeed, the potential for increased privacy is not the only benefit of distributing data analytics to the edges of the network: reducing the movement of large volumes of data can also improve energy efficiency, helping to ameliorate the ever increasing carbon footprint of our digital infrastructure, enabling much lower latency for service interactions than is possible when services are cloud-hosted.

Some previous methods either insufficiently fuse RGB and TIR features, or depend on intermediaries containing information from both modalities to achieve cross-modal information interaction. The former does not fully exploit the potential of using only RGB and TIR information of the template or search region for channel and spatial feature fusion, and the latter lacks direct interaction between the template and search area, which limits the model's ability to fully exploit the original semantic information of both modalities. To alleviate these limitations, we explore how to improve the performance of a visual Transformer by using direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features, and propose CSTNet. CSTNet uses ViT as a backbone and inserts cross-modal channel feature fusion modules (CFM) and cross-modal spatial feature fusion modules (SFM) for direct interaction between RGB and TIR features. The CFM performs parallel joint channel enhancement and joint multilevel spatial feature modeling of RGB and TIR features and sums the features, and then globally integrates the sum feature with the original features. The SFM uses cross-attention to model the spatial relationship of cross-modal features and then introduces a convolutional feedforward network for joint spatial and channel integration of multimodal features. We retrain the model with CSNet as the pre-training weights in the model with CFM and SFM removed, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 36% reduction in parameters and 24% reduction in Flops, and 50% speedup with a 1-2% performance decrease.

To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information.

This research holds the potential to advance our ability to predict large earthquakes and enhance the effectiveness of disaster prevention and mitigation strategies.

It also examines several seismological mechanisms that may contribute to the occurrence of these extraordinary events. Although applying the dragon-king theory to seismology presents practical challenges, it offers the potential to significantly enrich statistical seismology.

Accurate unbiased ETAS calibration is thus crucial. But we identify three sources of bias, (i) boundary effects, (ii) finite-size effects, and (iii) censorship, which are often overlooked or misinterpreted, causing errors in seismic analysis and predictions. By employing an ETAS model variant with variable spatial background rates, we propose a method to correct for these biases, focusing on the branching ratio n, a key indicator of earthquake triggering potential. Our approach quantifies the variation in the apparent branching ratio (napp) with increased cut-off magnitude (Mco) above the optimal cut-off (Mcobest). The napp(Mco) function yields insights superior to traditional point estimates. We validate our method using synthetic earthquake catalogs, accurately recovering the true branching ratio (ntrue) after correcting biases with napp(Mco). Additionally, our method introduces a refined estimation of the minimum triggering magnitude (m0), a crucial parameter in the ETAS model. Applying our framework to the earthquake catalogs of California, New Zealand, and the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES) in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, we find that seismicity hovers away from the critical point, nc = 1, remaining distinctly subcritical, however with values tending to be larger than recent reports that do not consider the above biases. It is interesting that, m0 is found around 4 for California, 3 for New Zealand and 2 for CSES, suggesting that many small triggered earthquakes may not be fertile. Understanding seismicity's critical state significantly enhances our comprehension of seismic patterns, aftershock predictability, and informs earthquake risk mitigation and management strategies.

In this study, we aim to shed light on this under-explored topic by rethinking the latent space from the perspective of model complexity. Our investigation starts with the classic generative adversarial networks (GANs). Inspired by the GAN training objective, we propose a novel ""distance"" between the latent and data distributions, whose minimization coincides with that of the generator complexity. The minimizer of this distance is characterized as the optimal data-dependent latent that most effectively capitalizes on the generator's capacity. Then, we consider parameterizing such a latent distribution by an encoder network and propose a two-stage training strategy called Decoupled Autoencoder (DAE), where the encoder is only updated in the first stage with an auxiliary decoder and then frozen in the second stage while the actual decoder is being trained. DAE can improve the latent distribution and as a result, improve the generative performance. Our theoretical analyses are corroborated by comprehensive experiments on various models such as VQGAN and Diffusion Transformer, where our modifications yield significant improvements in sample quality with decreased model complexity.

This compound uniquely manifests strong hybridization between the 4$f$ and conduction electrons, leading to a Kondo lattice state in the presence of ferromagnetic order.

In recent years, knowledge-enhanced stock price prediction methods have shown groundbreaking results by utilizing external knowledge to understand the stock market. Despite the importance of these methods, there is a scarcity of scholarly works that systematically synthesize previous studies from the perspective of external knowledge types. Specifically, the external knowledge can be modeled in different data structures, which we group into non-graph-based formats and graph-based formats: 1) non-graph-based knowledge captures contextual information and multimedia descriptions specifically associated with an individual stock; 2) graph-based knowledge captures interconnected and interdependent information in the stock market. This survey paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive description of methods for acquiring external knowledge from various unstructured data sources and then incorporating it into stock price prediction models.

Code smells are empirically tested as efficient indicators of non-DL systems. Therefore, we took a step forward into identifying code smells, and understanding their impact on maintenance in this comprehensive study. This is the first study on investigating code smells in the context of DL software systems, which helps researchers and practitioners to get a first look at what kind of maintenance modification made and what code smells developers have been dealing with. Our paper has three major contributions.

By integrating these two modalities, our approach effectively reasons over boththe gene expression level constraints provided by the scRNA-seq data and the structured biological knowledge inherent in GRNs.

Highly accurate and low-time-complexity decoding algorithms play an indispensable role in making sure quantum error correction works. Among existing decoding algorithms, belief propagation (BP) is notable for its nearly linear time complexity and general applicability to stabilizer codes. However, BP's decoding accuracy without post-processing is unsatisfactory in most situations. This article focuses on improving the decoding accuracy of BP over GF(4) for surface codes. We first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP, inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, to reduce oscillation in message updating and break the symmetric trapping sets. We further propose EWAInit-BP, which adaptively updates initial probabilities and provides a 1 to 3 orders of magnitude improvement over traditional BP for planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code without any post-processing method, showing high decoding accuracy even under parallel scheduling. The theoretical $O(1)$ time complexity under parallel scheduling and high accuracy of EWAInit-BP make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders.

Traditional methods rely on human annotations or, more recently, a set of class seed words for supervision, which can be costly, particularly for specialized or emerging domains. To address this, using class surface names alone as extremely weak supervision has been proposed. However, existing approaches treat different levels of text granularity (documents, sentences, or words) independently, disregarding inter-granularity class disagreements and the context identifiable exclusively through joint extraction. In order to tackle these issues, we introduce MEGClass, an extremely weakly-supervised text classification method that leverages Mutually-Enhancing Text Granularities. MEGClass utilizes coarse- and fine-grained context signals obtained by jointly considering a document's most class-indicative words and sentences. This approach enables the learning of a contextualized document representation that captures the most discriminative class indicators. By preserving the heterogeneity of potential classes, MEGClass can select the most informative class-indicative documents as iterative feedback to enhance the initial word-based class representations and ultimately fine-tune a pre-trained text classifier. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly supervised methods.

Furthermore, to implement soft-decision decoding, the observation of HMM is replaced by Gaussian mixture models (GMM).

We evaluated the performance of the method compared to standard Viterbi decoding by numerical simulation. In the multipath channel, the hybrid HMM decoder can achieve a performance gain of 4.7 dB and 2 dB when using hard-decision and soft-decision decoding, respectively.

In this setting, team members are allowed to coordinate their strategies only before the game starts. Although there existing algorithms for solving extensive-form ATMGs, the size of the game tree generated by the previous algorithms grows exponentially with the number of players. Therefore, how to deal with large-scale zero-sum extensive-form ATMGs problems close to the real world is still a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-player transformation algorithm, which can transform any multi-player game tree satisfying the definition of AMTGs into a 2-player game tree, such that finding a team-maxmin equilibrium with correlation (TMECor) in large-scale ATMGs can be transformed into solving NE in 2-player games. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a new structure named private information pre-branch, which consists of a temporary chance node and coordinator nodes and aims to make decisions for all potential private information on behalf of the team members. We also show theoretically that NE in the transformed 2-player game is equivalent TMECor in the original multi-player game. This work significantly reduces the growth of action space and nodes from exponential to constant level. This enables our work to outperform all the previous state-of-the-art algorithms in finding a TMECor, with 182.89, 168.47, 694.44, and 233.98 significant improvements in the different Kuhn Poker and Leduc Poker cases (21K3, 21K4, 21K6 and 21L33). In addition, this work first practically solves the ATMGs in a 5-player case which cannot be conducted by existing algorithms.

Distill Embodied Agent into a   Single Model,1970,"  With the power of large language models (LLMs), open-ended embodied agents can flexibly understand human instructions, generate interpretable guidance strategies, and output executable actions. Nowadays, Multi-modal Language Models~(MLMs) integrate multi-modal signals into LLMs, further bringing richer perception to entity agents and allowing embodied agents to perceive world-understanding tasks more delicately. However, existing works: 1) operate independently by agents, each containing multiple LLMs, from perception to action, resulting in gaps between complex tasks and execution; 2) train MLMs on static data, struggling with dynamics in open-ended scenarios; 3) input prior knowledge directly as prompts, suppressing application flexibility. We propose STEVE-2, a hierarchical knowledge distillation framework for open-ended embodied tasks, characterized by 1) a hierarchical system for multi-granular task division, 2) a mirrored distillation method for parallel simulation data, and 3) an extra expert model for bringing additional knowledge into parallel simulation. After distillation, embodied agents can complete complex, open-ended tasks without additional expert guidance, utilizing the performance and knowledge of a versatile MLM. Extensive evaluations on navigation and creation tasks highlight the superior performance of STEVE-2 in open-ended tasks, with $1.4 \times$ - $7.3 \times$ in performance.

In this article, following the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph proposed in our previous work, we try to construct new stabilizer codes with high coding rate, and propose XZ-type Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion (XZ-TGRE) code and Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion hypergraph product (TGRE-HP) code. XZ-TGRE code have zero asymptotic coding rate, but its coding rate tends to zero extremely slowly with the growth of code length. Under the same code length, its coding rate is much higher than that of surface code. The coding rate of TGRE-HP is the constant 0.2, which is the highest constant coding rate of stabilizer codes to our best knowledge. We prove that the code distance of XZ-TGRE code scales as $O(log(N))$, and that of TGRE-HP code scales as $O(\log \sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the code length. Moreover, the code capacity noise threshold of XZ-TGRE code is around 0.078, and that of TGRE-HP code is around 0.096. This articles shows that the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph might have potential to construct quantum codes with good performance.

Traditional alignment-based methods, though widely used, are computationally intense and reliant on extensive reference databases, often failing to detect novel pathogens due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, conventional machine learning techniques, while promising, require large annotated datasets and extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we introduce PathoLM, a cutting-edge pathogen language model optimized for the identification of pathogenicity in bacterial and viral sequences. Leveraging the strengths of pre-trained DNA models such as the Nucleotide Transformer, PathoLM requires minimal data for fine-tuning, thereby enhancing pathogen detection capabilities. It effectively captures a broader genomic context, significantly improving the identification of novel and divergent pathogens. We developed a comprehensive data set comprising approximately 30 species of viruses and bacteria, including ESKAPEE pathogens, seven notably virulent bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, we curated a species classification dataset centered specifically on the ESKAPEE group. In comparative assessments, PathoLM dramatically outperforms existing models like DciPatho, demonstrating robust zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. Furthermore, we expanded PathoLM-Sp for ESKAPEE species classification, where it showed superior performance compared to other advanced deep learning methods, despite the complexities of the task.

However, existing models typically sacrifice either accuracy or efficiency. Moreover, lightweight models are highly demanded for offering simulating systems on a considerably larger scale at reduced computational costs. A century ago, Felix Bloch demonstrated how leveraging the equivariance of the translation operation on a crystal lattice (with geometric symmetry) could significantly reduce the computational cost of determining wavefunctions and accurately calculate material properties. Here, we introduce a lightweight equivariant interaction graph neural network (LEIGNN) that can enable accurate and efficient interatomic potential and force predictions in crystals. Rather than relying on higher-order representations, LEIGNN employs a scalar-vector dual representation to encode equivariant features. By extracting both local and global structures from vector representations and learning geometric symmetry information, our model remains lightweight while ensuring prediction accuracy and robustness through the equivariance. Our results show that LEIGNN consistently outperforms the prediction performance of the representative baselines and achieves significant efficiency across diverse datasets, which include catalysts, molecules, and organic isomers. Finally, to further validate the predicted interatomic potentials from our model, we conduct classical molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD simulation across various systems, including solid, liquid, and gas. It is found that LEIGNN can achieve the accuracy of ab initio MD and retain the computational efficiency of classical MD across all examined systems, demonstrating its accuracy, efficiency, and universality.

They convert alternating current into direct one by allowing unidirectional charge flows. In analogy to the current-flow rectification for itinerary electrons, here, a polar rectification that based on the localized oxygen vacancies (OVs) in a Ti/fatigued-SrTiO3 (fSTO) Schottky junction is first demonstrated. The fSTO with OVs is produced by an electro-degradation process. The different movability of localized OVs and itinerary electrons in the fSTO yield a unidirectional electric polarization at the interface of the junction under the coaction of external and built-in electric fields. Moreover, the fSTO displays a pre-ferroelectric state located between paraelectric and ferroelectric phases.

In this study, we reveal the effects of multiorbital and magnetic ordering on Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at the LAO/STO (001) interface. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that the Rashba spin splitting near the conduction band edge can be tuned substantially by the interfacial insulator-metal transition due to the multiorbital effect of the lowest t_2g bands. We further unravel a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic magnetism, in which the Rashba SOC induced spin polarization is suppressed by the interfacial magnetic ordering. These results deepen our understanding of intricate electronic and magnetic reconstruction at the perovskite oxide interfaces and shed light on the engineering of oxide heterostructures for all-oxides-based spintronic devices.

However, it faces fundamental physical limitations, including hunting effects from the metallic layer, broken symmetry for enabling antidamping switching, spin scattering caused by interfacial defects, and sensitivity to stray magnetic fields. To address these issues, we here propose a van der Waals (vdW) field-free SOT antiferromagnetic memory using a vdW bilayer LaBr$_2$ (an antiferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy) and a monolayer T$_d$ phase WTe$_2$ (a Weyl semimetal with broken inversion symmetry). By systematically employing density functional theory in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green's function methods and macrospin simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed vdW SOT devices exhibit remarkably low critical current density approximately 10 MA/cm$^2$ and rapid field-free magnetization switching in 250 ps. This facilitates excellent write performance with extremely low energy consumption. Furthermore, the device shows a significantly low read error rate, as evidenced by a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio of up to 4250%. The superior write and read performance originates from the unique strong on-site (insulating phase) and off-site (magnetic phase) Coulomb interactions in electride LaBr$_2$, a large non-zero z-component polarization in WTe$_2$, and the proximity effect between them.

However, to date, no SDM transmissions over field-deployed FM-MCFs in realistic outdoor settings have been reported, which contrasts with SDM schemes demonstrated using single-mode multi-core fibers (SM-MCFs) installed in practical fiber cable ducts. In this paper, we present the successful demonstration of bidirectional SDM transmission over a 5-km field-deployed seven ring-core fiber (7-RCF) with a cladding diameter of 178 ${\mu}$m, achieving a Spectral Efficiency (SE) of 2$\times$201.6 bit/s/Hz. This work establishes a new record for the highest SE attained in SDM demonstrations utilizing field-deployed fiber cables, achieving an approximate 10x increase compared to the SE of reported field-deployed optical fiber cable transmission systems. Notably, these results are realized through the utilization of small-scale modular 4$\times$4 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing with a time-domain equalization (TDE) tap number not exceeding 15, maintaining a complexity per unit capacity comparable to that of MIMO equalization in SDM demonstrations employing weakly coupled SM-MCF cables. These results underscore the significant potential for achieving heightened SE and expanding capacity per individual fiber using SDM techniques in practical applications.

Here, we successfully synthesized Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ and conducted a comprehensive investigation involving crystallography, magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and PPMS DynaCool measurements, we studied Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP in detail. The hexagonal structure of parent EuAgP at room temperature, with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group, remains unaltered, while the lattice constants expand. The magnetic phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism, as temperature decreases, is suppressed through the gradual introduction of strontium doping. Heat capacity measurements reveal a shift from magnon-dominated to predominantly phonon and electron contributions near the ferromagnetic phase with increasing doping levels. The resistivity-temperature relationship displays distinct characteristics, emphasizing the impact of Sr doping on modifying charge transport. Magnetoresistance measurements uncover novel phenomena, illustrating the adjustability of magnetoresistance through Sr doping.

Contrasting with conventional 2-D RGB imaging, 4-D LF imaging excels in capturing scenes from multiple perspectives, thereby indirectly embedding geometric information. This intrinsic property is anticipated to effectively address the challenges associated with underwater imaging.

Various methods have been investigated extensively, but most only consider consistent rain/snow under stable background scenes. Rain/snow captured from practical surveillance camera, however, is always highly dynamic in time with the background scene transformed occasionally. To this issue, this paper proposes a novel rain/snow removal approach, which fully considers dynamic statistics of both rain/snow and background scenes taken from a video sequence. Specifically, the rain/snow is encoded as an online multi-scale convolutional sparse coding (OMS-CSC) model, which not only finely delivers the sparse scattering and multi-scale shapes of real rain/snow, but also well encodes their temporally dynamic configurations by real-time ameliorated parameters in the model. Furthermore, a transformation operator imposed on the background scenes is further embedded into the proposed model, which finely conveys the dynamic background transformations, such as rotations, scalings and distortions, inevitably existed in a real video sequence. The approach so constructed can naturally better adapt to the dynamic rain/snow as well as background changes, and also suitable to deal with the streaming video attributed its online learning mode. The proposed model is formulated in a concise maximum a posterior (MAP) framework and is readily solved by the ADMM algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art online and offline video rain/snow removal methods, the proposed method achieves better performance on synthetic and real videos datasets both visually and quantitatively.

Eddy current analyzing could provide an indication of conductivity change within a biological body. A significant obstacle to current trend analyses is the development of a numerically stable and efficiency-finite element scheme that performs well at low frequency and does not require a large number of degrees of freedom. Here, a custom finite element method (FEM) solver based on edge elements is proposed using the weakly coupled theory, which separates the solution into two steps. First, the background field (the magnetic vector potential on each edge) is calculated and stored. Then, the electric scalar potential on each node is obtained by FEM based on Galerkin formulations. Consequently, the electric field and eddy current distribution in the object can be obtained. This solver is more efficient than typical commercial solvers since it reduces the vector eddy current equation to a scalar one, and reduces the meshing domain to just the eddy current region. It can therefore tackle complex eddy current calculations for models with much larger numbers of elements, such as those encountered in eddy current computation in biological tissues. An example is presented with a realistic human brain mesh of 2 million elements. In addition, with this solver, the equivalent magnetic field induced from the excitation coil is applied, and therefore there is no need to mesh the excitation coil. In combination, these significantly increase the efficiency of the solver. ",https://doi.org/10.1002/bem.22148,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0E9EE250>,Yes,potent(2)

However, it is difficult to find a universal expression to predict the elastic moduli according to the glass composition before synthesis since the elastic moduli are a complex function of interatomic bonds and their ordering at different length scales. Here we show that the densities and elastic moduli of SiO2-based glasses can be efficiently predicted by machine learning (ML) techniques across a complex compositional space with multiple (>10) types of additive oxides besides SiO2. Our machine learning approach relies on a training set generated by high-throughput molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, a set of elaborately constructed descriptors that bridges the empirical statistical modeling with the fundamental physics of interatomic bonding, and a statistical learning/predicting model developed by implementing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a gradient boost machine (GBM-LASSO). The predictions of the ML model are comprehensively compared and validated with a large amount of both simulation and experimental data. By just training with a dataset only composed of binary and ternary glass samples, our model shows very promising capabilities to predict the density and elastic moduli for k-nary SiO2-based glasses beyond the training set. As an example of its potential applications, our GBM-LASSO model was used to perform a rapid and low-cost screening of many (~105) compositions of a multicomponent glass system to construct a compositional-property database that allows for a fruitful overview on the glass density and elastic properties.

In this scheme, a strong asymmetric plasma field is generated by plasma electron backflows between the two foils, leading to a significant radiation via the nonlinear Compton scatter. We show that by positioning the target at an appropriate tilt angle, the electrons emitting high-energy photons can gain high polarization and be reflected above the target. Moreover, the double-layer target setup not only strengthens the asymmetric plasma field but also induces a plasma bubble that further focuses the reflected electrons and reshape their polarization distribution. Our particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate the generation of a dense polarized electron beam with an average polarization exceeding 30% and a conversion rate greater than 10%. Through further selection of energy and angle, a picocoulomb electron beam with a current of approximately 0.4 kA and a polarization degree of 65% can be obtained at a energy peak of 1.5 GeV within 35$\times$35 mrad$^2$ angular spread and 10% energy spread.

A sub-text block is a sub-sequence of sentences in the article. We formulate the notion of content significance distribution (CSD) of sub-text blocks, referred to as CSD of the first kind and denoted by CSD-1. In particular, we leverage Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer to generate contextual sentence embeddings, and use MoverScore over text embeddings to measure how similar a sub-text block is to the entire text. To overcome the exponential blowup on the number of sub-text blocks, we present an approximation algorithm and show that the approximated CSD-1 is almost identical to the exact CSD-1. Under this approximation, we show that the average and median CSD-1's for news, scholarly research, argument, and narrative articles share the same pattern. We also show that under a certain linear transformation, the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution with certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ resembles a CSD-1 curve. We then use CSD-1's to extract linguistic features to train an SVC classifier for assessing how well an article is organized. Through experiments, we show that this method achieves high accuracy for assessing student essays. Moreover, we study CSD of sentence locations, referred to as CSD of the second kind and denoted by CSD-2, and show that average CSD-2's for different types of articles possess distinctive patterns, which either conform common perceptions of article structures or provide rectification with minor deviation.

Neural Adaptive Tomography (NeAT) is a recently proposed 3D rendering method based on neural radiance field for CT, and it demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with the substantial perturbations and pose shifts encountered in CT scanning processes. Here, we propose a neural rendering method for CT reconstruction, named Iterative Neural Adaptive Tomography (INeAT), which incorporates iterative posture optimization to effectively counteract the influence of posture perturbations in data, particularly in cases involving significant posture variations.

We demonstrate that INeAT achieves artifact-suppressed and resolution-enhanced reconstruction in scenarios with significant pose disturbances. Furthermore, we show that our INeAT maintains comparable reconstruction performance to stable-state acquisitions even using data from unstable-state acquisitions, which significantly reduces the time required for CT scanning and relaxes the stringent requirements on imaging hardware systems, underscoring its immense potential for applications in short-time and low-cost CT technology.

While AR models produce high-quality solutions, they generally have a high inference latency due to their sequential generation nature. Conversely, NAR models generate solutions in parallel with a low inference latency but generally exhibit inferior performance.

GNARKD removes the constraint of sequential generation in AR models while preserving the learned pivotal components in the network architecture to obtain the corresponding NAR models through knowledge distillation. We evaluate GNARKD by applying it to three widely adopted AR models to obtain NAR VRP solvers for both synthesized and real-world instances. The experimental results demonstrate that GNARKD significantly reduces the inference time (4-5 times faster) with acceptable performance drop (2-3\%).

Recently significant efforts have focused on exploring excitons in solids as a pathway to achieving nonlinearities even down to few-photon levels. However, a crucial tradeoff arises as strong light-matter interactions require large oscillator strength and short radiative lifetime of the excitons, which limits their interaction strength and nonlinearity. Here we experimentally demonstrate strong nonlinear optical responses by exploiting the coupling between excitons and carriers in an atomically thin semiconductor of trilayer tungsten diselenide. By controlling the electric field and electrostatic doping of the trilayer, we observe the hybridization between intralayer and interlayer excitons along with the formation of Fermi polarons due to the interactions between excitons and free carriers. We find substantial optical nonlinearity can be achieved under both continuous wave and pulsed laser excitation, where the resonance of the hole-doped Fermi polaron blueshifts by as much as ~10 meV. Intriguingly, we observe a remarkable asymmetry in the optical nonlinearity between electron and hole doping, which is tunable by the applied electric field. We attribute these features to the strong interactions between excitons and free charges with optically induced valley polarization.

Here, we report bilayer Wigner crystal formation without a magnetic or confinement field in atomically thin MoSe$_2$ bilayers separated by hexagonal boron nitride. We observe optical signatures of robust correlated insulating states formed at symmetric (1:1) and asymmetric (4:1 and 7:1) electron doping of the two MoSe$_2$ layers at cryogenic temperatures. We attribute these features to the bilayer Wigner crystals formed from two commensurate triangular electron lattices in each layer, stabilized via inter-layer interaction. These bilayer Wigner crystal phases are remarkably stable and undergo quantum and thermal melting transitions above a critical electron density of up to $6 \times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and at temperatures of ~40 K. Our results demonstrate that atomically thin semiconductors provide a promising new platform for realizing strongly correlated electronic states, probing their electronic and magnetic phase transitions, and developing novel applications in quantum electronics and optoelectronics.

However, a major obstacle to fully understanding these systems and harnessing their potential is the limited ability to correlate the local moir\'e structure with optical properties. By using a recently developed scanning electron microscopy technique to image twisted WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayers, we directly correlate increasing moir\'e periodicity with the emergence of two distinct exciton species. These can be tuned individually through electrostatic gating, and feature different valley coherence properties. Our observations can be understood as resulting from an array of two intralayer exciton species residing in alternating locations in the superlattice, and illuminate the influence of the moir\'e potential on lateral exciton motion. They open up new avenues for controlling exciton arrays in twisted TMDs, with applications in quantum optoelectronics and explorations of novel many body systems.

Accordingly, generating arbitrary large size of the geological texture with similar topological structures at a low computation cost has become one of the key tasks for realistic geomaterial reconstruction. Recently, generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) have demonstrated a potential of synthesizing input textural images and creating equiprobable geomaterial images. However, the texture synthesis with the GANs framework is often limited by the computational cost and scalability of the output texture size. In this study, we proposed a spatially assembled GANs (SAGANs) that can generate output images of an arbitrary large size regardless of the size of training images with computational efficiency. The performance of the SAGANs was evaluated with two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) rock image samples widely used in geostatistical reconstruction of the earth texture. We demonstrate SAGANs can generate the arbitrary large size of statistical realizations with connectivity and structural properties similar to training images, and also can generate a variety of realizations even on a single training image.

The signatures of its proximity to Kitaev quantum spin liquid in the honeycomb antiferromagnet includes anisotropic bond-dependent magnetic responses and persistent fluctuation by frustration in paramagnetic regime. Here, we propose Cu3Co2SbO6 heterostructures as an intriguing honeycomb antiferromagnet for quantum spin liquid, wherein bond-dependent and frustrated spins interact with optical excitons. This system exhibits antiferromagnetism at 16 K with different spin-flip magnetic fields between a bond-parallel and bond-perpendicular directions, aligning more closely with the generalized Heisenberg-Kitaev than the XXZ model. Optical spectroscopy reveals a strong excitonic transition coupled to the antiferromagnetism, enabling optical detection of its spin states. Particularly, such spin-exciton coupling presents anisotropic responses between bond-parallel and bond-perpendicular magnetic field as well as a finite spin-spin correlation function around 40 K, higher than twice its N\'eel temperature. The characteristic temperature that remains barely changed even under strong magnetic fields highlights the robustness of the spin-fluctuation region.

In order to put a TI into any practical use, these materials need to be fabricated into devices whose basic units are often p-n junctions. Unique electronic properties of a 'topological' p-n junction were proposed theoretically such as the junction electronic state and the spin rectification.

Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach to realize a p-n junction of topological surface states (TSS's) of a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) with an atomically abrupt interface. When a ultrathin Sb film is grown on a 3D TI of Bi2Se3 with a typical n-type TSS, the surface develops a strongly p-type TSS through the substantial hybridization between the 2D Sb film and the Bi2Se3 surface. Thus, the Bi2Se3 surface covered partially with Sb films bifurcates into areas of n- and p-type TSS's as separated by atomic step edges with a lateral electronic junction of as short as 2 nm.

Relevant turbulence properties,1970,"  Turbulence in the protoplanetary disks induces collisions between dust grains, and thus facilitates grain growth. We investigate the two fundamental assumptions of the turbulence in obtaining grain collisional velocities -- the kinetic energy spectrum and the turbulence autocorrelation time -- in the context of the turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We carry out numerical simulations of the MRI as well as driven turbulence, for a range of physical and numerical parameters. We find that the convergence of the turbulence $\alpha$-parameter does not necessarily imply the convergence of the energy spectrum. The MRI turbulence is largely solenoidal, for which we observe a persistent kinetic energy spectrum of $k^{-4/3}$. The same is obtained for solenoidal driven turbulence with and without magnetic field, over more than 1 dex near the dissipation scale. This power-law slope appears to be converged in terms of numerical resolution, and to be due to the bottleneck effect. The kinetic energy in the MRI turbulence peaks at the fastest growing mode of the MRI. In contrast, the magnetic energy peaks at the dissipation scale. The magnetic energy spectrum in the MRI turbulence does not show a clear power-law range, and is almost constant over approximately 1 dex near the dissipation scale. The turbulence autocorrelation time is nearly constant at large scales, limited by the shearing timescale, and shows a power-law drop close to $k^{-1}$ at small scales, with a slope steeper than that of the eddy crossing time. The deviation from the standard picture of the Kolmogorov turbulence with the injection scale at the disk scale height can potentially have a significant impact on the grain collisional velocities.

Here, we prove theoretically that such a notion is only accurate under idealized conditions, and further show that when non-radiative recombination is taken into account, efficiency improvement can be achieved by broadening the emission spectrum, due to an enhancement in the open-circuit voltage. Broadening the emission spectrum also improves the electrical power density, by increasing the short-circuit current. To practically illustrate these findings, we focus on surface polariton-mediated near-field TPVs. We propose a versatile design strategy for broadening the emission spectrum via stacking of multiple plasmonic thin film layers. As an example, we consider a realistic ITO/InAs TPV, and predict a conversion efficiency of $50\%$ simultaneously with a power density of nearly $80$ W$/\mathrm{cm}^2$ at a $1300$ K emitter temperature.

0000-0002-6780-1633,Bo Zhao,"Yonsei University, Yonsei University - Mirae Campus",Protostellar Disk Formation Enabled by Removal of Small Dust Grains,1970,"  It has been shown that a realistic level of magnetization of dense molecular cloud cores can suppress the formation of a rotationally supported disk (RSD) through catastrophic magnetic braking in the axisymmetric ideal MHD limit. In this study, we present conditions for the formation of RSDs through non-ideal MHD effects computed self-consistently from an equilibrium chemical network. We find that removing from the standard MRN distribution the large population of very small grains (VSGs) of ~10 $\AA$ to few 100 $\AA$ that dominate the coupling of the bulk neutral matter to the magnetic field increases the ambipolar diffusivity by ~1--2 orders of magnitude at densities below 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. The enhanced ambipolar diffusion (AD) in the envelope reduces the amount of magnetic flux dragged by the collapse into the circumstellar disk-forming region. Therefore, magnetic braking is weakened and more angular momentum can be retained. With continuous high angular momentum inflow, RSDs of tens of AU are able to form, survive, and even grow in size, depending on other parameters including cosmic-ray ionization rate, magnetic field strength, and rotation speed. Some disks become self-gravitating and evolve into rings in our 2D (axisymmetric) simulations, which have the potential to fragment into (close) multiple systems in 3D. We conclude that disk formation in magnetized cores is highly sensitive to chemistry, especially to grain sizes. A moderate grain coagulation/growth to remove the large population of VSGs, either in the prestellar phase or during free-fall collapse, can greatly promote AD and help formation of tens of AU RSDs.

Surface plasmons in a monolayer graphene can couple with a hyperbolic phonon polaritons in a single hBN film to form hybrid polaritons that can assist photon tunneling. For periodic multilayer graphene/hBN structures, the stacked metallic/dielectric array can give rise to a further effective hyperbolic behavior, in addition to the intrinsic natural hyperbolic behavior of hBN. The effective hyperbolicity can enable more hyperbolic polaritons that enhance the photon tunneling and hence the near-field heat transfer. However, the hybrid polaritons on the surface, i.e. surface plasmon-phonon polaritons, dominate the near-field heat transfer between multilayer structures when the topmost layer is graphene. The effective hyperbolic regions can be well predicted by the effective medium theory (EMT), thought EMT fails to capture the hybrid surface polaritons and results in a heat transfer rate much lower compared to the exact calculation. The chemical potential of the graphene sheets can be tuned through electrical gating and results in an additional modulation of the heat transfer. We found that the near-field heat transfer between multilayer structure does not increase monotonously with the number of layer in the stack, which provides a way to control the heat transfer rate by the number of graphene layers in the multilayer structure. The results may benefit the applications of near-field energy harvesting and radiative cooling based on hybrid polaritons in two-dimensional materials.

MMR contains paired positive and negative questions across 12 categories, meticulously annotated by humans.

0000-0002-6780-1633,Bo Zhao,"Yonsei University, Yonsei University - Mirae Campus",Makeup216: Logo Recognition with Adversarial Attention Representations,1970,"  One of the challenges of logo recognition lies in the diversity of forms, such as symbols, texts or a combination of both; further, logos tend to be extremely concise in design while similar in appearance, suggesting the difficulty of learning discriminative representations. To investigate the variety and representation of logo, we introduced Makeup216, the largest and most complex logo dataset in the field of makeup, captured from the real world. It comprises of 216 logos and 157 brands, including 10,019 images and 37,018 annotated logo objects. In addition, we found that the marginal background around the pure logo can provide a important context information and proposed an adversarial attention representation framework (AAR) to attend on the logo subject and auxiliary marginal background separately, which can be combined for better representation. Our proposed framework achieved competitive results on Makeup216 and another large-scale open logo dataset, which could provide fresh thinking for logo recognition. The dataset of Makeup216 and the code of the proposed framework will be released soon. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,<Element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id' at 0x0000024A0F011170>,Yes,fresh(1)
0000-0002-6780-1633,Bo Zhao,"Yonsei University, Yonsei University - Mirae Campus",Magnetic Flux Expulsion in Star Formation,1970,"  Stars form in dense cores of magnetized molecular clouds. If the magnetic flux threading the cores is dragged into the stars, the stellar field would be orders of magnitude stronger than observed. This well-known ""magnetic flux problem"" demands that most of the core magnetic flux be decoupled from the matter that enters the star. We carry out the first exploration of what happens to the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive mesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink particle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase of star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the accreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is released anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a low-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled. This decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD simulations of star formation. It generates a strong asymmetry in the protostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star. In the presence of an initial core rotation, the structure presents an obstacle to the formation of a rotationally supported disk, in addition to magnetic braking, by acting as a rigid magnetic wall that prevents the rotating gas from completing a full orbit around the central object. We conclude that the decoupled magnetic flux from the stellar matter can strongly affect the protostellar collapse dynamics.

We have observed 24 new interspecies Feshbach resonances at magnetic field up to 350 G. A full coupled-channel calculation is performed to assign these resonances. Among them, 12 resonances are identified as d-wave Feshbach resonances. These d-wave Feshbach resonances are about 5 G systematically smaller than the predications based on previous model potential. Taking into account these new experimental results, we improve the Born-Oppenheimer potentials between Na and K, and achieve good agreement between the theory and experiment for all the observed Feshbach resonances.

0000-0002-6780-1633,Bo Zhao,"Yonsei University, Yonsei University - Mirae Campus",Decoupling of Magnetic Fields in Collapsing Protostellar Envelopes and   Disk Formation and Fragmentation,1970,"  Efficient magnetic braking is a formidable obstacle to the formation of rotationally supported disks (RSDs) around protostars in magnetized dense cores. We have previously shown, through 2D (axisymmetric) non-ideal MHD simulations, that removing very small grains (VSGs: ~10 \AA$~$to few 100 \AA) can greatly enhance ambipolar diffusion and enable the formation of RSDs. Here we extend the simulations of disk formation enabled by VSG removal to 3D. We find that the key to this scenario of disk formation is that the drift velocity of the magnetic field almost cancels out the infall velocity of the neutrals in the $10^2$-$10^3$ AU-scale ""pseudo-disk"" where the field lines are most severely pinched and most of protostellar envelope mass infall occurs. As a result, the bulk neutral envelope matter can collapse without dragging much magnetic flux into the disk-forming region, which lowers the magnetic braking efficiency. We find that the initial disks enabled by VSG removal tend to be Toomre-unstable, which leads to the formation of prominent spiral structures that function as centrifugal barriers. The piling-up of infall material near the centrifugal barrier often produces dense fragments of tens of Jupiter masses, especially in cores that are not too strongly magnetized. Some fragments accrete onto the central stellar object, producing bursts in mass accretion rate. Others are longer lived, although whether they can survive long-term to produce multiple systems remains to be ascertained. Our results highlight the importance of dust grain evolution in determining the formation and properties of protostellar disks and potentially multiple systems.

However, there is a notable paucity of detailed, open-sourced methodologies on efficiently scaling LLMs beyond 50 billion parameters with minimum trial-and-error cost and computational resources. In this report, we introduce Tele-FLM (aka FLM-2), a 52B open-sourced multilingual large language model that features a stable, efficient pre-training paradigm and enhanced factual judgment capabilities. Tele-FLM demonstrates superior multilingual language modeling abilities, measured by BPB on textual corpus. Besides, in both English and Chinese foundation model evaluation, it is comparable to strong open-sourced models that involve larger pre-training FLOPs, such as Llama2-70B and DeepSeek-67B. In addition to the model weights, we share the core designs, engineering practices, and training details, which we expect to benefit both the academic and industrial communities.

As scaling laws underscore the potential of increasing model sizes, the academic community has intensified its investigations into LLMs with capacities exceeding 50 billion parameters. This technical report builds on our prior work with Tele-FLM (also known as FLM-2), a publicly available 52-billion-parameter model. We delve into two primary areas: we first discuss our observation of Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on Tele-FLM-52B, which supports the ""less is more"" approach for SFT data construction; second, we demonstrate our experiments and analyses on the best practices for progressively growing a model from 52 billion to 102 billion, and subsequently to 1 trillion parameters. We will open-source a 1T model checkpoint, namely Tele-FLM-1T, to advance further training and research.

Of particular concern is the use of multi-mode fibers (MMFs), which introduce modal noise and accept significant amounts of background radiation from the sky. We present the design of a single-mode fiber-based acquisition camera for a diffraction-limited spectrometer named ""iLocater."" By using the ""extreme"" adaptive optics (AO) system of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), iLocater will overcome the limitations that prevent Doppler instruments from reaching their full potential, allowing precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of terrestrial planets around nearby bright stars. The instrument presented in this paper, which we refer to as the acquisition camera ""demonstration system,"" will measure on-sky single-mode fiber (SMF) coupling efficiency using one of the 8.4m primaries of the LBT in fall 2015.

In this work, we present a novel complex-amplitude profiler based on spatial Stokes tomography with the capability to fully determine the SCA of a light field in a single shot with high precision and resolution. The SCA slice observed at any propagation plane provides complete information about the light field, thus allowing us to further retrieve the complete beam structure in 3 dimensions space, as well as the exact modal constitution in terms of spatial degrees of freedom. The principle demonstrated here provides an important advancement for the full characterization of light beams with a broad spectrum of potential applications in various areas of optics, especially for the growing field of structured light.
