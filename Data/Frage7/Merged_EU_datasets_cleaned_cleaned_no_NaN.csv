0000-0001-6252-7658,Matthew Baugh,"Imperial College London, Imperial College London Department of Computing",Trade-offs in Fine-tuned Diffusion Models Between Accuracy and   Interpretability,1970,"  Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly impacted the trajectory of generative machine learning research, with many adopting the strategy of fine-tuning pre-trained models using domain-specific text-to-image datasets. Notably, this method has been readily employed for medical applications, such as X-ray image synthesis, leveraging the plethora of associated radiology reports. Yet, a prevailing concern is the lack of assurance on whether these models genuinely comprehend their generated content. With the evolution of text-conditional image generation, these models have grown potent enough to facilitate object localization scrutiny. Our research underscores this advancement in the critical realm of medical imaging, emphasizing the crucial role of interpretability. We further unravel a consequential trade-off between image fidelity as gauged by conventional metrics and model interpretability in generative diffusion models. Specifically, the adoption of learnable text encoders when fine-tuning results in diminished interpretability. Our in-depth exploration uncovers the underlying factors responsible for this divergence. Consequently, we present a set of design principles for the development of truly interpretable generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/MischaD/chest-distillation.

0000-0001-6252-7658,Matthew Baugh,"Imperial College London, Imperial College London Department of Computing",DISYRE: Diffusion-Inspired SYnthetic REstoration for Unsupervised   Anomaly Detection,1970,"  Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) techniques aim to identify and localize anomalies without relying on annotations, only leveraging a model trained on a dataset known to be free of anomalies. Diffusion models learn to modify inputs $x$ to increase the probability of it belonging to a desired distribution, i.e., they model the score function $\nabla_x \log p(x)$. Such a score function is potentially relevant for UAD, since $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ is itself a pixel-wise anomaly score. However, diffusion models are trained to invert a corruption process based on Gaussian noise and the learned score function is unlikely to generalize to medical anomalies. This work addresses the problem of how to learn a score function relevant for UAD and proposes DISYRE: Diffusion-Inspired SYnthetic REstoration. We retain the diffusion-like pipeline but replace the Gaussian noise corruption with a gradual, synthetic anomaly corruption so the learned score function generalizes to medical, naturally occurring anomalies. We evaluate DISYRE on three common Brain MRI UAD benchmarks and substantially outperform other methods in two out of the three tasks. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2311.15453v2,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-0201-4874,Wenjun Guo,Imperial College London,Different Regular Black Holes: Geodesic Structures of Test Particles,1970,"  This paper investigates the metric of previously proposed regular black holes, calculates their effective potentials, and plots the curves of the effective potentials. By determining the conserved quantities, the dynamical equations for particles and photons near the black hole are derived. The analysis encompasses timelike and null geodesics in different spacetimes, including bound geodesics, unstable circular geodesics, stable circular geodesics, and escape geodesics. The findings are presented through figures and tables. Furthermore, the bound geodesics of the four regular black hole spacetimes are analyzed, examining the average distance of particle orbits from the center of the event horizon, the precession behavior of the perihelion, and the probability of particles appearing inside the outer event horizon during motion. Based on these analyses, a general formula is proposed, which yields the existing metrics when specific parameter values are chosen. The impact of parameter variations on the effective potential and geodesics is then computed using this new formula. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2309.12932v1,Yes,potent(3)
0000-0002-0201-4874,Wenjun Guo,Imperial College London,Scalar field quasinormal modes of noncommutative high dimensional   Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole spacetime with smeared matter sources,1970,"  We investigate the massless scalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the noncommutative $D$-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole spacetime in this paper. By using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation method, the asymptotic iterative method (AIM) and the inverted potential method (IPM) method, we made a detail analysis of the massless scalar QNM frequencies by varying the general smeared matter distribution and the allowable characteristic parameters ($k$ and $\theta$) corresponding to different dimensions. It is found that the nonconvergence of the high order WKB approximation exists in the QNMs frequencies of scalar perturbation around the noncommutative $D$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. We conclude that the 3rd WKB result should be more reliable than those of the high order WKB method since our numerical results are also verified by the AIM method and the IPM method. In the dimensional range of $4\leq D \leq7$, the scalar QNMs as a function of the different papameters (the noncommutative parameter $\theta$, the smeared matter distribution parameter $k$, the multipole number $l$ and the main node number $n$) are obtained. Moreover, we study the dynamical evolution of a scalar field in the background of the noncommutative high dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole.

0000-0002-0201-4874,Wenjun Guo,Imperial College London,Quasinormal modes of scalar field coupled to Einstein's tensor in the   non-commutative geometry inspired black hole,1970,"  We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar field coupled to the Einstein's tensor in the non-commutative geometry inspired black hole spacetime. It is found that the lapse function of the non-commutative black hole metric can be represented by a Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function, which can effectively solve the problem that the numerical results of the QNMs are sensitive to the model parameters and make the QNMs values more reliable. We make a careful analysis of the scalar QNM frequencies by using several numerical methods, and find that the numerical results obtained by the new WKB method (the Pad\'e approximants) and the Mashhoon method (P$\ddot{\text{o}}$schl-Teller potential method) are quite different from those obtained by the asymptotic iterative method (AIM) and time-domain integration method when the non-commutative parameter $\theta$ and coupling parameter $\eta$ are large. The most obvious difference is that the numerical results obtained by the AIM and the time-domain integration method appear a critical value $\eta_c$ with an increase of $\eta$, which leads to the dynamical instability. After carefully analyzing the numeral results, we conclude that the numerical results obtained by the AIM and the time-domain integration method are closer to the theoretical values than those obtained by the WKB method and the Mashhoon method, when the $\theta$ and $\eta$ are large. Moreover, through a numerical fitting, we obtain that the functional relationship between the threshold $\eta_c$ and the non-commutative parameter $\theta$ satisfies $\eta_{c}=a\theta^{b}+c$ for a fixed $l$ approximately. We find that the stability of dynamics can be ensured in the $\eta<\eta_c(\theta, l)$ region. ",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2021.115595,2012.03004v2,Yes,potent(1)

Specifically, we propose a novel Cross-modal Sample Selection method (CromSS) that utilizes the class distributions P^{(d)}(x,c) over pixels x and classes c modelled by multiple sensors/modalities d of a given geospatial scene. Consistency of predictions across sensors $d$ is jointly informed by the entropy of P^{(d)}(x,c). Noisy label sampling we determine by the confidence of each sensor d in the noisy class label, P^{(d)}(x,c=y(x)). To verify the performance of our approach, we conduct experiments with Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery from the globally-sampled SSL4EO-S12 dataset. We pair those scenes with 9-class noisy labels sourced from the Google Dynamic World project for pretraining. Transfer learning evaluations (downstream task) on the DFC2020 dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for remote sensing image segmentation.

0000-0002-6946-727X,Chenying Liu,"New College, University of Oxford, University of Oxford",AutoLCZ: Towards Automatized Local Climate Zone Mapping from Rule-Based   Remote Sensing,1970,"  Local climate zones (LCZs) established a standard classification system to categorize the landscape universe for improved urban climate studies. Existing LCZ mapping is guided by human interaction with geographic information systems (GIS) or modelled from remote sensing (RS) data. GIS-based methods do not scale to large areas. However, RS-based methods leverage machine learning techniques to automatize LCZ classification from RS. Yet, RS-based methods require huge amounts of manual labels for training.   We propose a novel LCZ mapping framework, termed AutoLCZ, to extract the LCZ classification features from high-resolution RS modalities. We study the definition of numerical rules designed to mimic the LCZ definitions. Those rules model geometric and surface cover properties from LiDAR data. Correspondingly, we enable LCZ classification from RS data in a GIS-based scheme. The proposed AutoLCZ method has potential to reduce the human labor to acquire accurate metadata. At the same time, AutoLCZ sheds light on the physical interpretability of RS-based methods. In a proof-of-concept for New York City (NYC) we leverage airborne LiDAR surveys to model 4 LCZ features to distinguish 10 LCZ types. The results indicate the potential of AutoLCZ as promising avenue for large-scale LCZ mapping from RS data. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2405.13993v1,Yes,potent(2)
0000-0002-6946-727X,Chenying Liu,"New College, University of Oxford, University of Oxford",Naive Gabor Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification,1970,"  Recently, many convolutional neural network (CNN) methods have been designed for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification since CNNs are able to produce good representations of data, which greatly benefits from a huge number of parameters. However, solving such a high-dimensional optimization problem often requires a large amount of training samples in order to avoid overfitting. Additionally, it is a typical non-convex problem affected by many local minima and flat regions. To address these problems, in this paper, we introduce naive Gabor Networks or Gabor-Nets which, for the first time in the literature, design and learn CNN kernels strictly in the form of Gabor filters, aiming to reduce the number of involved parameters and constrain the solution space, and hence improve the performances of CNNs. Specifically, we develop an innovative phase-induced Gabor kernel, which is trickily designed to perform the Gabor feature learning via a linear combination of local low-frequency and high-frequency components of data controlled by the kernel phase. With the phase-induced Gabor kernel, the proposed Gabor-Nets gains the ability to automatically adapt to the local harmonic characteristics of the HSI data and thus yields more representative harmonic features. Also, this kernel can fulfill the traditional complex-valued Gabor filtering in a real-valued manner, hence making Gabor-Nets easily perform in a usual CNN thread. We evaluated our newly developed Gabor-Nets on three well-known HSIs, suggesting that our proposed Gabor-Nets can significantly improve the performance of CNNs, particularly with a small training set.

However, traditional ground surveys are both costly and limited in scale. With the increasing accessibility of aerial and satellite data, machine learning techniques bear large potential for the automatic detection and recognition of archaeological landscapes. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic model fusion method for ancient agricultural terrace detection.

We hypothesised that an artificial intelligence (AI) powered triage and diagnostic system would compare favourably with human doctors with respect to triage and diagnostic accuracy. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of an AI powered triage and diagnostic system. Identical cases were evaluated by both an AI system and human doctors. Differential diagnoses and triage outcomes were evaluated by an independent judge, who was blinded from knowing the source (AI system or human doctor) of the outcomes. Independently of these cases, vignettes from publicly available resources were also assessed to provide a benchmark to previous studies and the diagnostic component of the MRCGP exam. Overall we found that the Babylon AI powered Triage and Diagnostic System was able to identify the condition modelled by a clinical vignette with accuracy comparable to human doctors (in terms of precision and recall). In addition, we found that the triage advice recommended by the AI System was, on average, safer than that of human doctors, when compared to the ranges of acceptable triage provided by independent expert judges, with only a minimal reduction in appropriateness.

The device architecture consists of graphene deposited on a ferroelectric substrate which encodes a periodic surface potential achieved through domain engineering.

0000-0003-4252-6070,Tianyi Zhang,"University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge Clare College",PMFL: Partial Meta-Federated Learning for heterogeneous tasks and its   applications on real-world medical records,1970,"  Federated machine learning is a versatile and flexible tool to utilize distributed data from different sources, especially when communication technology develops rapidly and an unprecedented amount of data could be collected on mobile devices nowadays. Federated learning method exploits not only the data but the computational power of all devices in the network to achieve more efficient model training. Nevertheless, while most traditional federated learning methods work well for homogeneous data and tasks, adapting the method to a different heterogeneous data and task distribution is challenging. This limitation has constrained the applications of federated learning in real-world contexts, especially in healthcare settings. Inspired by the fundamental idea of meta-learning, in this study we propose a new algorithm, which is an integration of federated learning and meta-learning, to tackle this issue. In addition, owing to the advantage of transfer learning for model generalization, we further improve our algorithm by introducing partial parameter sharing. We name this method partial meta-federated learning (PMFL). Finally, we apply the algorithms to two medical datasets.

0000-0003-4252-6070,Tianyi Zhang,"University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge Clare College",Pancreatic Cancer ROSE Image Classification Based on Multiple Instance   Learning with Shuffle Instances,1970,"  The rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) technique can significantly ac-celerate the diagnostic workflow of pancreatic cancer by immediately analyzing the fast-stained cytopathological images with on-site pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using the deep learning method has the potential to solve the problem of insufficient pathology staffing. However, the cancerous patterns of ROSE images vary greatly between different samples, making the CAD task extremely challenging. Besides, due to different staining qualities and various types of acquisition devices, the ROSE images also have compli-cated perturbations in terms of color distribution, brightness, and contrast. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel multiple instance learning (MIL) approach using shuffle patches containing the instances, which adopts the patch-based learning strategy of Vision Transformers. With the re-grouped bags of shuffle instances and their bag-level soft labels, the approach utilizes a MIL head to make the model focus on the features from the pancreatic cancer cells, rather than that from various perturbations in ROSE images. Simultaneously, combined with a classification head, the model can effectively identify the gen-eral distributive patterns across different instances. The results demonstrate the significant improvements in the classification accuracy with more accurate at-tention regions, indicating that the diverse patterns of ROSE images are effec-tively extracted, and the complicated perturbations of ROSE images are signifi-cantly eliminated. It also suggests that the MIL with shuffle instances has great potential in the analysis of cytopathological images. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2206.03080v1,Yes,potent(2)

While previous studies have explored discrete representations to enhance model generalization across minor distributional shifts, these approaches often struggle to adapt to new data silos with significantly divergent distributions. In response, we have identified that models derived from FL exhibit markedly increased uncertainty when applied to data silos with unfamiliar distributions. Consequently, we propose an innovative yet straightforward iterative framework, termed Uncertainty-Based Extensible-Codebook Federated Learning (UEFL). This framework dynamically maps latent features to trainable discrete vectors, assesses the uncertainty, and specifically extends the discretization dictionary or codebook for silos exhibiting high uncertainty. Our approach aims to simultaneously enhance accuracy and reduce uncertainty by explicitly addressing the diversity of data distributions, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead in environments characterized by heterogeneous data silos. Through experiments conducted on five datasets, our method has demonstrated its superiority, achieving significant improvements in accuracy (by 3%--22.1%) and uncertainty reduction (by 38.83%--96.24%), thereby outperforming contemporary state-of-the-art methods.

An active research area, digital phenotyping, involves collecting and analysing data from personal digital devices such as smartphones (usage and sensors) and wearables to infer behaviours and mental health. Whilst this data is standardly analysed using statistical and machine learning approaches, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new approach to make sense of smartphone sensing data. Despite their effectiveness across various domains, LLMs remain relatively unexplored in digital mental health, particularly in integrating mobile sensor data.

We propose to let the user equipments (UE) transmit Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences and let the base station (BS) conduct maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the uplink channel. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient: it uses ZC sequences to decouple the estimation of the frequency and time offsets; it uses the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) method to reduce the high-dimensional problem due to the multipaths to multiple lower-dimensional ones per path. Owing to the estimation of the Doppler frequency offsets, the time-varying channel state can be projected, which can significantly lower the overhead of the pilots for channel estimation.

When the magnetizations of the two MI layers are parallel, the longitudinal conductance in the HM layer is greater than that in the antiparallel state according to the magnetic proximity effect, termed as the in-plane magnon valve effect. We investigate the dependence of MV ratio (MVR), which is the relative change in longitudinal conductance between the parallel and antiparallel MV states, on the difference in electronic structure between magnetized and non-magnetized metal atoms, revealing that MVR can reach 100%. Additionally, the dependence of MVR on the thickness of metal layer is analyzed, revealing an exponential decrease with increasing thickness. Then we investigate the dependence of HM layer conductance on the relative angle between the magnetizations of two MI layers, illustrating the potential of MV as a magneto-sensitive magnonic sensor.

0000-0003-4252-6070,Tianyi Zhang,"University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge Clare College",IDentity with Locality: An ideal hash for gene sequence search,1970,"  Gene sequence search is a fundamental operation in computational genomics. Due to the petabyte scale of genome archives, most gene search systems now use hashing-based data structures such as Bloom Filters (BF). The state-of-the-art systems such as Compact bit-slicing signature index (COBS) and Repeated And Merged Bloom filters (RAMBO) use BF with Random Hash (RH) functions for gene representation and identification. The standard recipe is to cast the gene search problem as a sequence of membership problems testing if each subsequent gene substring (called kmer) of Q is present in the set of kmers of the entire gene database D. We observe that RH functions, which are crucial to the memory and the computational advantage of BF, are also detrimental to the system performance of gene-search systems. While subsequent kmers being queried are likely very similar, RH, oblivious to any similarity, uniformly distributes the kmers to different parts of potentially large BF, thus triggering excessive cache misses and causing system slowdown. We propose a novel hash function called the Identity with Locality (IDL) hash family, which co-locates the keys close in input space without causing collisions. This approach ensures both cache locality and key preservation. IDL functions can be a drop-in replacement for RH functions and help improve the performance of information retrieval systems. We give a simple but practical construction of IDL function families and show that replacing the RH with IDL functions reduces cache misses by a factor of 5x, thus improving query and indexing times of SOTA methods such as COBS and RAMBO by factors up to 2x without compromising their quality. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the false positive rate of BF with IDL functions.

Each other node in the network is a potential buyer with a valuation derived from a common distribution. With a standard fixed-price mechanism, the seller can only sell the item among her neighbours. To improve her revenue, she needs more buyers to join in the sale. To achieve this, we propose the very first fixed-price mechanism to incentivize the seller's neighbours to inform their neighbours about the sale and to eventually inform all buyers in the network to improve seller's revenue. Compared with the existing mechanisms for the same purpose, our mechanism does not require the buyers to reveal their valuations and it is computationally easy.

There is one node called the source to which all the other nodes want to connect and it does not share the costs of the connectivity. As a node may need to go through other nodes to reach the source, the intermediate nodes may behave strategically to block the connection by cutting the edges adjacent to them.

Each node except for the source has a private valuation of the connection, and it may block others' connections by strategically cutting its adjacent edges to reduce its cost share, which may increase the total cost. We aim to design mechanisms to prevent the nodes from misreporting their valuations and cutting their adjacent edges. We first show that it is impossible for such a mechanism to further satisfy budget balance (cover the total cost) and efficiency (maximize social welfare).

The cost (weight) of each edge is private information reported by multiple contractors, and among them, only one contractor is selected as the builder. All the nodes except for the source need to share the total cost of the used edges. However, they may block others' connections to the source by strategically cutting their outgoing edges to reduce their cost share, which may increase the total cost of connectivity. To minimize the total cost of connectivity, we design a cost sharing mechanism to incentivize each node to offer all its outgoing edges and each contractor to report all the edges' weights truthfully, and show the properties of the proposed mechanism. In addition, our mechanism outperforms the two benchmark mechanisms. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2311.08903v1,Yes,strategically(1)

Yet its reliability and safety have drawn a lot of attention and concerns. Compared with traditional software systems, autonomous driving systems (ADSs) often use deep neural networks in tandem with logic-based modules. This new paradigm poses unique challenges for software testing. Despite the recent development of new ADS testing techniques, it is not clear to what extent those techniques have addressed the needs of ADS practitioners. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study to identify the current practices and needs of ADS testing. We conducted semi-structured interviews with developers from 10 autonomous driving companies and surveyed 100 developers who have worked on autonomous driving systems. A systematic analysis of the interview and survey data revealed 7 common practices and 4 emerging needs of autonomous driving testing.

We introduce a simple, low-bandwidth computational pipeline to address these challenges. Our approach is based on a novel streaming representation with a small memory footprint, efficiently capturing intensity information at multiple temporal scales. Updating the representation requires only 16 floating-point operations/pixel, which can be efficiently computed online at the native frame rate of the binary frames. We use a neural network operating on this representation to reconstruct videos in real-time (10-30 fps). We illustrate why such representation is well-suited for these emerging sensors, and how it offers low latency and high frame rate while retaining flexibility for downstream computer vision. Our approach results in significant data bandwidth reductions ~100X and real-time image reconstruction and computer vision -- $10^4$-$10^5$ reduction in computation than existing state-of-the-art approach while maintaining comparable quality.

Existing GNNs are primarily designed to learn node-wise representations and usually fail to capture pairwise relations between target nodes, which proves to be crucial for link prediction. Recent works resort to learning more expressive edge-wise representations by enhancing vanilla GNNs with structural features such as labeling tricks and link prediction heuristics, but they suffer from high computational overhead and limited scalability. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn structural link representations by augmenting the message-passing framework of GNNs with Bloom signatures. Bloom signatures are hashing-based compact encodings of node neighborhoods, which can be efficiently merged to recover various types of edge-wise structural features. We further show that any type of neighborhood overlap-based heuristic can be estimated by a neural network that takes Bloom signatures as input. GNNs with Bloom signatures are provably more expressive than vanilla GNNs and also more scalable than existing edge-wise models. Experimental results on five standard link prediction benchmarks show that our proposed model achieves comparable or better performance than existing edge-wise GNN models while being 3-200 $\times$ faster and more memory-efficient for online inference.

However, most models generally require large-scale annotated data for training, which faces challenges due to the sampling and annotation scarcity in pathological images. The rapid developing generative models shows potential to generate more training samples from recent studies. However, they also struggle in generalization diversity with limited training data, incapable of generating effective samples. Inspired by the pathological transitions between different stages, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled diffusion (ADD) network to generate pathological progressive images for effective data augmentation. This novel approach roots in domain migration, where a hybrid attention strategy guides the bidirectional diffusion, blending local and global attention priorities. With feature measuring, the adaptive depth-controlled strategy ensures the migration and maintains locational similarity in simulating the pathological feature transition. Based on tiny training set (samples less than 500), the ADD yields cross-domain progressive images with corresponding soft-labels.

In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian Splatting (RecGS), which takes advantage of today's photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology, 3DGS, to separate caustics from seafloor imagery. With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods, including joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches.

To bridge this gap, we initiate to create a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify the current challenges and explore future opportunities.

One of the crucial methods towards this assurance is the meticulous construction and execution of test scenarios, a task often regarded as tedious and laborious. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces TARGET, an end-to-end framework designed for the automatic generation of test scenarios grounded in established traffic rules. Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) with concise and expressive syntax for scenario descriptions. To handle the natural language complexity and ambiguity in traffic rule descriptions, we leverage a large language model to automatically extract knowledge from traffic rules and convert the traffic rule descriptions to DSL representations. Based on these representations, TARGET synthesizes executable test scenario scripts to render the testing scenarios in a simulator. Comprehensive evaluations of the framework were conducted on four distinct ADSs, yielding a total of 217 test scenarios spread across eight diverse maps. These scenarios identify approximately 700 rule violations, collisions, and other significant issues, including navigation failures. Moreover, for each detected anomaly, TARGET provides detailed scenario recordings and log reports, significantly easing the process of troubleshooting and root cause analysis. Two of these causes have been confirmed by the ADS developers; one is corroborated by an existing bug report from the ADS, and the other one is attributed to the limited functionality of the ADS.

Recently, several deep learning based clone detectors are proposed to detect semantic clones. However, these approaches have high cost in data labelling and model training.

We then labeled all 557 incorrect code snippets based on this taxonomy. Our results showed that the six LLMs exhibited similar distributions of syntactic characteristics while different distributions of semantic characteristics.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can potentially address the shortage of pathologists in ROSE. However, the cancerous patterns vary significantly between different samples, making the CAD task extremely challenging. Besides, the ROSE images have complicated perturbations regarding color distribution, brightness, and contrast due to different staining qualities and various acquisition device types. To address these challenges, we proposed a shuffle instances-based Vision Transformer (SI-ViT) approach, which can reduce the perturbations and enhance the modeling among the instances. With the regrouped bags of shuffle instances and their bag-level soft labels, the approach utilizes a regression head to make the model focus on the cells rather than various perturbations. Simultaneously, combined with a classification head, the model can effectively identify the general distributive patterns among different instances. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the classification accuracy with more accurate attention regions, indicating that the diverse patterns of ROSE images are effectively extracted, and the complicated perturbations are significantly reduced.

Transfer learning using pre-trained models initialized on natural images has effectively improved the downstream pathological performance. However, the lack of sophisticated domain-specific pathological initialization hinders their potential. Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables pre-training without sample-level labels, which has great potential to overcome the challenge of expensive annotations. Thus, studies focusing on pathological SSL pre-training call for a comprehensive and standardized dataset, similar to the ImageNet in computer vision. This paper presents the comprehensive pathological image analysis (CPIA) dataset, a large-scale SSL pre-training dataset combining 103 open-source datasets with extensive standardization.

This multi-scale dataset is built with the diagnosis habits under the supervision of experienced senior pathologists. The CPIA dataset facilitates a comprehensive pathological understanding and enables pattern discovery explorations.

To overcome this challenge, mixing-based methods have emerged as effective alternatives to traditional preprocessing data augmentation techniques. Nonetheless, these methods fail to fully consider the unique features of pathology images, such as local specificity, global distribution, and inner/outer-sample instance relationships. To better comprehend these characteristics and create valuable pseudo samples, we propose the CellMix framework, which employs a novel distribution-oriented in-place shuffle approach. By dividing images into patches based on the granularity of pathology instances and shuffling them within the same batch, the absolute relationships between instances can be effectively preserved when generating new samples. Moreover, we develop a curriculum learning-inspired, loss-driven strategy to handle perturbations and distribution-related noise during training, enabling the model to adaptively fit the augmented data.

Some recent studies have successfully used the metamorphic testing technique to detect thousands of potential issues in some popularly used autonomous driving models.

As instances that appear in the real world are naturally connected and can be represented with graphs, graph neural networks become increasingly popular in tackling the anomaly detection problem. Despite the promising results, research on anomaly detection has almost exclusively focused on static graphs while the mining of anomalous patterns from dynamic graphs is rarely studied but has significant application value. In addition, anomaly detection is typically tackled from semi-supervised perspectives due to the lack of sufficient labeled data. However, most proposed methods are limited to merely exploiting labeled data, leaving a large number of unlabeled samples unexplored.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide an ideal platform for achieving this goal through techniques including alloying, doping, and creating in-plane or out-of-plane heterostructures. Here, we report on the synthesis and characterization of atomically controlled two-dimensional graded alloy of MoxW1-xS2, wherein the center region is Mo rich and gradually transitions towards a higher concentration of W atoms at the edges. This unique alloy structure leads to a continuously tunable bandgap, ranging from 1.85 eV in the center to 1.95 eV at the edges consistent with the larger band gap of WS2 relative to MoS2. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of sulfur monovacancy, VS, whose concentration varied across the graded MoxW1-xS2 layer as a function of Mo content with the highest value in the Mo rich center region. Optical spectroscopy measurements supported by ab initio calculations reveal a doublet electronic state of VS, which was split due to the spin-orbit interaction, with energy levels close to the conduction band or deep in the band gap depending on whether the vacancy is surrounded by W atoms or Mo atoms. This unique electronic configuration of VS in the alloy gave rise to four spin-allowed optical transitions between the VS levels and the valence bands.

However, their properties can be altered by intrinsic and extrinsic defects, thus diminishing their applicability. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify defects and understand 2D materials' degradation over time using advanced multimodal imaging techniques as well as stabilize degradation via built-in interface protection. Here we implemented a liquid-phase precursor approach to synthesize 2D in-plane MoS2-WS2 heterostructures exhibiting nanoscale alloyed interfaces and map exotic interface effects during photo-degradation using a novel combination of hyperspectral tip-enhanced photoluminescence, Raman and near-field nanoscopy. Surprisingly, 2D alloyed regions exhibit remarkable thermal and photo-degradation stability providing protection against oxidation. Coupled with surface and interface strain, 2D alloy regions create localized potential wells that concentrate excitonic species via a charge carrier funneling effect. These results provide a clear understanding of the importance of 2D alloys as systems able to withstand degradation effects over time, and could be now used to stabilize optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

0000-0003-4252-6070,Tianyi Zhang,"University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge Clare College",Wafer-scale epitaxial growth of single orientation WS2 monolayers on   sapphire,1970,"  Realization of wafer-scale single-crystal films of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as tungsten sulfide requires epitaxial growth and coalescence of oriented domains to form a continuous monolayer. The domains must be oriented in the same crystallographic direction on the substrate to avoid the formation of metallic inversion domain boundaries (IDBs) which are a common feature of layered chalcogenides. Here we demonstrate fully-coalesced single orientation tungsten sulfide monolayers on 2-inch diameter c-plane sapphire by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using a multi-step growth process. High growth temperatures and sulfur/metal ratios were required to reduce domain misorientation and achieve epitaxial tungsten sulfide monolayers with low in-plane rotational twist (0.09 deg). Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the tungsten sulfide monolayers lack IDBs but instead have translational boundaries that arise when tungsten sulfide domains with slightly off-set lattices merge together. By adjusting the monolayer growth rate, the density of translational boundaries and bilayer coverage were significantly reduced. The preferred orientation of domains is attributed to the presence of steps on the sapphire surface coupled with growth conditions promote surface diffusion and oriented attachment. The transferred tungsten sulfide monolayers show neutral and charged exciton emission at 80K with negligible defect-related luminescence. Back-gated tungsten sulfide field effect transistors exhibited mobility of 16 cm2/Vs. The results demonstrate the potential of achieving wafer-scale TMD monolayers free of inversion domains with properties approaching that of exfoliated flakes.

Low-loss dielectric nanoantennas hold particular promise for this purpose, owing to their strong Mie resonances. Herein, we explore a highly miniaturized platform for the control of emission based on individual subwavelength Si nanospheres (SiNSs) to modulate the directional excitation and exciton emission of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). A modified Mie theory for dipole-sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance. Controllable forward-to-backward intensity ratios are experimentally validated in 532 nm laser excitation and 635 nm exciton emission from a monolayer WS2. Versatile light emission control along all device orientations is achieved for different emitters and excitation wavelengths, benefiting from the facile size control and isotropic shape of SiNSs. Simultaneous modulation of excitation and emission via a single SiNS at visible wavelengths significantly improves the efficiency and directivity of TMD exciton emission and leads to the potential of multifunctional integrated photonics. Overall, our work opens promising opportunities for nanophotonics and polaritonic systems, enabling efficient manipulation, enhancement and reconfigurability of light-matter interactions.

0000-0003-4252-6070,Tianyi Zhang,"University of Cambridge, University of Cambridge Clare College",Remote-contact catalysis for target-diameter semiconducting carbon   nanotube array,1970,"  Electrostatic catalysis has been an exciting development in chemical synthesis (beyond enzymes catalysis) in recent years, boosting reaction rates and selectively producing certain reaction products. Most of the studies to date have been focused on using external electric field (EEF) to rearrange the charge distribution in small molecule reactions such as Diels-Alder addition, carbene reaction, etc. However, in order for these EEFs to be effective, a field on the order of 1 V/nm (10 MV/cm) is required, and the direction of the EEF has to be aligned with the reaction axis. Such a large and oriented EEF will be challenging for large-scale implementation, or materials growth with multiple reaction axis or steps. Here, we demonstrate that the energy band at the tip of an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) can be spontaneously shifted in a high-permittivity growth environment, with its other end in contact with a low-work function electrode (e.g., hafnium carbide or titanium carbide). By adjusting the Fermi level at a point where there is a substantial disparity in the density of states (DOS) between semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWCNTs, we achieve effective electrostatic catalysis for s-SWCNT growth assisted by a weak EEF perturbation (200V/cm). This approach enables the production of high-purity (99.92%) s-SWCNT horizontal arrays with narrow diameter distribution (0.95+-0.04 nm), targeting the requirement of advanced SWCNT-based electronics for future computing. These findings highlight the potential of electrostatic catalysis in precise materials growth, especially for s-SWCNTs, and pave the way for the development of advanced SWCNT-based electronics.

Recently, the correlations between nonlinear optical responses and topological properties, such as Berry curvature and the quantum metric tensor, have stimulated great interest. Here, we report giant room-temperature nonlinearities in an emergent non-centrosymmetric two-dimensional topological material, the Janus transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T' phase, which are synthesized by an advanced atomic-layer substitution method. High harmonic generation, terahertz emission spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation measurements consistently reveal orders-of-the-magnitude enhancement in terahertz-frequency nonlinearities of 1T' MoSSe (e.g., > 50 times higher than 2H MoS$_2$ for 18th order harmonic generation; > 20 times higher than 2H MoS$_2$ for terahertz emission). It is elucidated that such colossal nonlinear optical responses come from topological band mixing and strong inversion symmetry breaking due to the Janus structure. Our work defines general protocols for designing materials with large nonlinearities and preludes the applications of topological materials in optoelectronics down to the monolayer limit. This two-dimensional form of topological materials also constitute a unique platform for examining origin of the anomalous high-harmonic generation, with potential applications as building blocks for scalable attosecond sources.

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit. We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2211.09110v2,Yes,potent(1)

Several central banks now publish indices of financial stress, which are essentially based upon market related data. In this paper, we examine the potential for improving the indices by deriving information about emotion shifts in the economy. We report on a new approach, based on the content analysis of very large text databases, and termed directed algorithmic text analysis. The algorithm identifies, very rapidly, shifts through time in the relations between two core emotional groups. The method is robust. The same word-list is used to identify the two emotion groups across different studies. Membership of the words in the lists has been validated in psychological experiments. The words consist of everyday English words with no specific economic meaning. Initial results show promise. An emotion index capturing shifts between the two emotion groups in texts potentially referring to the whole US economy improves the one-quarter ahead consensus forecasts for real GDP growth. More specifically, the same indices are shown to Granger cause both the Cleveland and St Louis Federal Reserve Indices of Financial Stress. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1508.05357v1,Yes,potent(2)

Consequently, a large amount of research into the disease pathogenesis and potential treatments has been carried out in a short time frame. However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements.

Estimation of latent parameters in these models has the potential to provide highly desirable capabilities such as network self-calibration. Conventional solutions to the problem pose difficulties in scaling with the number of sensors due to the joint multi-sensor filtering involved when evaluating the parameter likelihood. In this article, we propose a separable pseudo-likelihood which is a more accurate approximation compared to a previously proposed alternative under typical operating conditions. In addition, we consider using separable likelihoods in the presence of many objects and ambiguity in associating measurements with objects that originated them. To this end, we use a state space model with a hypothesis based parameterisation, and, develop an empirical Bayesian perspective in order to evaluate separable likelihoods on this model using local filtering. Bayesian inference with this likelihood is carried out using belief propagation on the associated pairwise Markov random field. We specify a particle algorithm for latent parameter estimation in a linear Gaussian state space model and demonstrate its efficacy for network self-calibration using measurements from non-cooperative targets in comparison with alternatives.

Machine learning methods can help improve both speed and accuracy of this process. Specifically, deep learning image segmentation models using the U-Net structure perform faster and can identify areas missed by more restrictive approaches, such as expert hand-labeling and a priori heuristic methods. This paper discusses four different state-of-the-art U-Net models designed for detection of tropical and extratropical cyclone Regions Of Interest (ROI) from two separate input sources: total precipitable water output from the Global Forecasting System (GFS) model and water vapor radiance images from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). These models are referred to as IBTrACS-GFS, Heuristic-GFS, IBTrACS-GOES, and Heuristic-GOES. All four U-Nets are fast information extraction tools and perform with a ROI detection accuracy ranging from 80% to 99%. These are additionally evaluated with the Dice and Tversky Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics, having Dice coefficient scores ranging from 0.51 to 0.76 and Tversky coefficients ranging from 0.56 to 0.74. The extratropical cyclone U-Net model performed 3 times faster than the comparable heuristic model used to detect the same ROI. The U-Nets were specifically selected for their capabilities in detecting cyclone ROI beyond the scope of the training labels. These machine learning models identified more ambiguous and active ROI missed by the heuristic model and hand-labeling methods commonly used in generating real-time weather alerts, having a potentially direct impact on public safety.

Due to the harsh radiative environment outside the Earth's atmosphere, it is anticipated that the CCDs over the mission lifetime will be degraded to an extent that these measurements will only be possible through the correction of radiation damage effects. We have therefore created a Monte Carlo model that simulates the physical processes taking place when transferring signal through a radiation-damaged CCD. The software is based on Shockley-Read-Hall theory, and is made to mimic the physical properties in the CCD as closely as possible. The code runs on a single electrode level and takes three dimensional trap position, potential structure of the pixel, and multi-level clocking into account. A key element of the model is that it also takes device specific simulations of electron density as a direct input, thereby avoiding to make any analytical assumptions about the size and density of the charge cloud. This paper illustrates how test data and simulated data can be compared in order to further our understanding of the positions and properties of the individual radiation-induced traps.

It is valid for terrain following mass or height coordinates and for both Eulerian or vertically Lagrangian discretizations. The discretization relies on an extension to Simmons and Burridge (1981) vertical differencing which we show obeys a discrete derivative product rule. This product rule allows us to simplify the treatment of the vertical transport terms. Energy conservation is obtained via a term-by-term balance in the kinetic, internal and potential energy budgets, ensuring an energy-consistent discretization with no spurious sources of energy.

However, it remains a challenge to effectively fuse structural and functional features in exploring the brain network. In this paper, a novel brain structure-function fusing-representation learning (BSFL) model is proposed to effectively learn fused representation from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. Specifically, the decomposition-fusion framework is developed to first decompose the feature space into the union of the uniform and the unique spaces for each modality, and then adaptively fuse the decomposed features to learn MCI-related representation. Moreover, a knowledge-aware transformer module is designed to automatically capture local and global connectivity features throughout the brain. Also, a uniform-unique contrastive loss is further devised to make the decomposition more effective and enhance the complementarity of structural and functional features. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better performance than other competitive methods in predicting and analyzing MCI.

Learning these irregular data in graphs is challenging and still suffers from shallow learning. Applying deep learning on graphs has recently showed good performance in many applications in social analysis, bioinformatics etc. A message passing graph convolution network is such a powerful method which has expressive power to learn graph structures. Meanwhile, circRNA is a type of non-coding RNA which plays a critical role in human diseases. Identifying the associations between circRNAs and diseases is important to diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases. However, there are limited number of known associations between them and conducting biological experiments to identify new associations is time consuming and expensive. As a result, there is a need of building efficient and feasible computation methods to predict potential circRNA-disease associations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolution network framework to learn features from a graph built with multi-source similarity information to predict circRNA-disease associations. First we use multi-source information of circRNA similarity, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity to extract the features using first graph convolution.

With the development of the machine learning and neuroimaging technology, extensive research has been conducted on machine classification of ASD based on structural MRI (s-MRI). However, most studies involve with datasets where participants' age are above 5. Few studies conduct machine classification of ASD for participants below 5-year-old, but, with mediocre predictive accuracy. In this paper, we push the boundary of predictive accuracy (above 0.97) of machine classification of ASD in children (age range: 0.92-4.83 years), based on s-MRI features extracted using contrastive variational autoencoder (CVAE). 78 s-MRI, collected from Shenzhen Children's Hospital, are used for training CVAE, which consists of both ASD-specific feature channel and common shared feature channel. The ASD participants represented by ASD-specific features can be easily discriminated from TC participants represented by the common shared features, leading to high classification accuracy. In case of degraded predictive accuracy when data size is extremely small, a transfer learning strategy is proposed here as a potential solution. Finally, we conduct neuroanatomical interpretation based on the correlation between s-MRI features extracted from CVAE and surface area of different cortical regions, which discloses potential biomarkers that could help target treatments of ASD in the future.

0000-0002-9837-454X,Yi Pan,The University of Manchester,Reconstruction of Hidden Representation for Robust Feature Extraction,1970,"  This paper aims to develop a new and robust approach to feature representation. Motivated by the success of Auto-Encoders, we first theoretical summarize the general properties of all algorithms that are based on traditional Auto-Encoders: 1) The reconstruction error of the input can not be lower than a lower bound, which can be viewed as a guiding principle for reconstructing the input. Additionally, when the input is corrupted with noises, the reconstruction error of the corrupted input also can not be lower than a lower bound. 2) The reconstruction of a hidden representation achieving its ideal situation is the necessary condition for the reconstruction of the input to reach the ideal state. 3) Minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation has a deficiency and may result in a much worse local optimum value. We believe that minimizing the reconstruction error of the hidden representation is more robust than minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation. Based on the above analysis, we propose a new model termed Double Denoising Auto-Encoders (DDAEs), which uses corruption and reconstruction on both the input and the hidden representation. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly flexible and extensible and has a potentially better capability to learn invariant and robust feature representations. We also show that our model is more robust than Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs) for dealing with noises or inessential features. Furthermore, we detail how to train DDAEs with two different pre-training methods by optimizing the objective function in a combined and separate manner, respectively. Comparative experiments illustrate that the proposed model is significantly better for representation learning than the state-of-the-art models.

0000-0002-9837-454X,Yi Pan,The University of Manchester,Topological States in Dimerized Quantum-Dot Chains Created by Atom   Manipulation,1970,"  Topological electronic phases exist in a variety of naturally occurring materials but can also be created artificially. We used a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope to create dimerized chains of identical quantum dots on a semiconductor surface and to demonstrate that these chains give rise to one-dimensional topological phases. The dots were assembled from charged adatoms, creating a confining potential with single-atom precision acting on electrons in surface states of the semiconductor. Quantum coupling between the dots leads to electronic states localized at the ends of the chains, as well as at deliberately created internal domain walls, in agreement with the predictions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy also reveals deviations from this well-established model manifested in an asymmetric level spectrum and energy shifts of the boundary states. The deviations arise because the dots are charged and hence lead to an onsite potential that varies along the chain. We show that this variation can be mitigated by electrostatic gating using auxiliary charged adatoms, enabling fine-tuning of the boundary states and control of their quantum superposition. The experimental data, which are complemented by theoretical modeling of the potential and the resulting eigenstates, reveal the important role of electrostatics in these engineered quantum structures.

0000-0002-9837-454X,Yi Pan,The University of Manchester,Topological boundary states in engineered quantum-dot molecules on the   InAs(111)A surface,1970,"  Atom manipulation by scanning tunneling microscopy was used to construct quantum dots on the InAs(111)A surface. Each dot comprised six ionized indium adatoms. The positively charged adatoms create a confining potential acting on surface-state electrons, leading to the emergence of a bound state associated with the dot. By lining up the dots into N-dot chains with alternating tunnel coupling between them, quantum-dot molecules were constructed that revealed electronic boundary states as predicted by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model of one-dimensional topological phases. Dot chains with odd N were constructed such that they host a single end or domain-wall state, allowing one to probe the localization of the boundary state on a given sublattice by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We found probability density also on the forbidden sublattice together with an asymmetric energy spectrum of the chain-confined states. This deviation from the SSH model arises because the dots are charged and create a variation in onsite potential along the chain - which does not remove the boundary states but shifts their energy away from the midgap position. Our results demonstrate that topological boundary states can be created in quantum-dot arrays engineered with atomic-scale precision. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2406.13347v1,Yes,potent(2)

Prior studies have primarily focused on general and generic domains, with relatively less research on specialized LLMs in the medical field. The specialization and high accuracy requirements for diagnosis in the medical field, as well as the challenges in collecting large-scale data, have constrained the application and development of LLMs in medical scenarios. In the field of ophthalmology, clinical diagnosis mainly relies on doctors' interpretation of reports and making diagnostic decisions. In order to take advantage of LLMs to provide decision support for doctors, we collected three modalities of ophthalmic report data and fine-tuned the LLaMA2 model, successfully constructing an LLM termed the ""Ophtha-LLaMA2"" specifically tailored for ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Inference test results show that even with a smaller fine-tuning dataset, Ophtha-LLaMA2 performs significantly better in ophthalmic diagnosis compared to other LLMs. It demonstrates that the Ophtha-LLaMA2 exhibits satisfying accuracy and efficiency in ophthalmic disease diagnosis, making it a valuable tool for ophthalmologists to provide improved diagnostic support for patients. This research provides a useful reference for the application of LLMs in the field of ophthalmology, while showcasing the immense potential and prospects in this domain.

In this paper, we compute the GW energy flux and GW frequency derivative from a highly accurate numerical simulation of an equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary. We also estimate the (derivative of the) center-of-mass energy from the simulation by assuming energy balance. We compare these quantities with the predictions of various PN approximants (adiabatic Taylor and Pade models; non-adiabatic effective-one-body (EOB) models). We find that Pade summation of the energy flux does not accelerate the convergence of the flux series; nevertheless, the Pade flux is markedly closer to the numerical result for the whole range of the simulation (about 30 GW cycles). Taylor and Pade models overestimate the increase in flux and frequency derivative close to merger, whereas EOB models reproduce more faithfully the shape of and are closer to the numerical flux, frequency derivative and derivative of energy. We also compare the GW phase of the numerical simulation with Pade and EOB models. Matching numerical and untuned 3.5 PN order waveforms, we find that the phase difference accumulated until $M \omega = 0.1$ is -0.12 radians for Pade approximants, and 0.50 (0.45) radians for an EOB approximant with Keplerian (non-Keplerian) flux. We fit free parameters within the EOB models to minimize the phase difference, and confirm degeneracies among these parameters. By tuning pseudo 4PN order coefficients in the radial potential or in the flux, or, if present, the location of the pole in the flux, we find that the accumulated phase difference can be reduced - if desired - to much less than the estimated numerical phase error (0.02 radians).

Utilizing information from recent numerical relativity simulations and the natural flexibility of the effective-one-body (EOB) model, we extend the latter so that it can successfully match the numerical relativity waveforms during the last stages of inspiral, merger and ringdown. By ``successfully'' here, we mean with phase differences < 8% of a gravitational-wave cycle accumulated by the end of the ringdown phase, maximizing only over time of arrival and initial phase. We obtain this result by simply adding a 4-post-Newtonian order correction in the EOB radial potential and determining the (constant) coefficient by imposing high-matching performances with numerical waveforms of mass ratios m1/m2 = 1, 3/2, 2 and 4, m1 and m2 being the individual black-hole masses. The final black-hole mass and spin predicted by the numerical simulations are used to determine the ringdown frequency and decay time of three quasi-normal-mode damped sinusoids that are attached to the EOB inspiral-(plunge) waveform at the EOB light-ring. The EOB waveforms might be tested and further improved in the future by comparison with extremely long and accurate inspiral numerical-relativity waveforms. They may already be employed for coherent searches and parameter estimation of gravitational waves emitted by non-spinning coalescing binary black holes with ground-based laser-interferometer detectors.

However, the diversity and cross-source heterogeneity of these data challenge the generalizability of current data-mining methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently transformed many domains, significantly affecting the medical field. Notably, Gemini-Vision-series (Gemini) and GPT-4-series (GPT-4) models have epitomized a paradigm shift in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for computer vision, showcasing their potential in the biomedical domain. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Gemini, GPT-4, and 4 popular large models for an exhaustive evaluation across 14 medical imaging datasets, including 5 medical imaging categories (dermatology, radiology, dentistry, ophthalmology, and endoscopy), and 3 radiology report datasets. The investigated tasks encompass disease classification, lesion segmentation, anatomical localization, disease diagnosis, report generation, and lesion detection. Our experimental results demonstrated that Gemini-series models excelled in report generation and lesion detection but faces challenges in disease classification and anatomical localization. Conversely, GPT-series models exhibited proficiency in lesion segmentation and anatomical localization but encountered difficulties in disease diagnosis and lesion detection. Additionally, both the Gemini series and GPT series contain models that have demonstrated commendable generation efficiency. While both models hold promise in reducing physician workload, alleviating pressure on limited healthcare resources, and fostering collaboration between clinical practitioners and artificial intelligence technologies, substantial enhancements and comprehensive validations remain imperative before clinical deployment.

0000-0002-6203-7867,Qian Yang,The University of Manchester,"Towards Prototyping Driverless Vehicle Behaviors, City Design, and   Policies Simultaneously",1970,"  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can potentially improve urban living by reducing accidents, increasing transportation accessibility and equity, and decreasing emissions. Realizing these promises requires the innovations of AV driving behaviors, city plans and infrastructure, and traffic and transportation policies to join forces. However, the complex interdependencies among AV, city, and policy design issues can hinder their innovation. We argue the path towards better AV cities is not a process of matching city designs and policies with AVs' technological innovations, but a process of iterative prototyping of all three simultaneously: Innovations can happen step-wise as the knot of AV, city, and policy design loosens and tightens, unwinds and reties. In this paper, we ask: How can innovators innovate AVs, city environments, and policies simultaneously and productively toward better AV cities? The paper has two parts. First, we map out the interconnections among the many AV, city, and policy design decisions, based on a literature review spanning HCI/HRI, transportation science, urban studies, law and policy, operations research, economy, and philosophy. This map can help innovators identify design constraints and opportunities across the traditional AV/city/policy design disciplinary bounds. Second, we review the respective methods for AV, city, and policy design, and identify key barriers in combining them: (1) Organizational barriers to AV-city-policy design collaboration, (2) computational barriers to multi-granularity AV-city-policy simulation, and (3) different assumptions and goals in joint AV-city-policy optimization. We discuss two broad approaches that can potentially address these challenges, namely, ""low-fidelity integrative City-AV-Policy Simulation (iCAPS)"" and ""participatory design optimization"".

The sensing devices continuously generate a significant quantity of data, which provide tremendous opportunities to develop innovative intelligent applications. To utilize these data to train machine learning models while not compromising user privacy, federated learning has become a promising solution. However, there is little understanding of whether federated learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge. We reconsider model averaging in federated learning and formulate it as a gradient-based method with biased gradients. This novel perspective assists analysis of its convergence rate and provides a new direction for more acceleration. We prove for the first time that the federated averaging algorithm is guaranteed to converge for non-convex problems, without imposing additional assumptions. We further propose a novel accelerated federated learning algorithm and provide a convergence guarantee.

Due to its pivotal role in guiding customers towards purchasing, there is a natural motivation for unscrupulous parties to spoof RS for profits. In this paper, we study the shilling attack: a subsistent and profitable attack where an adversarial party injects a number of user profiles to promote or demote a target item. Conventional shilling attack models are based on simple heuristics that can be easily detected, or directly adopt adversarial attack methods without a special design for RS. Moreover, the study on the attack impact on deep learning based RS is missing in the literature, making the effects of shilling attack against real RS doubtful. We present a novel Augmented Shilling Attack framework (AUSH) and implement it with the idea of Generative Adversarial Network. AUSH is capable of tailoring attacks against RS according to budget and complex attack goals, such as targeting a specific user group. We experimentally show that the attack impact of AUSH is noticeable on a wide range of RS including both classic and modern deep learning based RS, while it is virtually undetectable by the state-of-the-art attack detection model.

However, in real application scenarios, users always write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the contextual information within these characters holds the significant potential to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In this work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network, namely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR. It couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to exploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although VCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it exposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such as sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of sentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion network~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the backbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings, and integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their contextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also construct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to evaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared with VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and case studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of handwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete strokes being recognized precisely.

As a result, clinicians cannot easily or rapidly scrutinize the CDSS recommendation when facing a difficult diagnosis or treatment decision in practice. Over-trust or under-trust are frequent. Prior research has explored supporting such assessments by explaining DST data inputs and algorithmic mechanisms. This paper explores a different approach: Providing precisely relevant, scientific evidence from biomedical literature. We present a proof-of-concept system, Clinical Evidence Engine, to demonstrate the technical and design feasibility of this approach across three domains (cardiovascular diseases, autism, cancer). Leveraging Clinical BioBERT, the system can effectively identify clinical trial reports based on lengthy clinical questions (e.g., ""risks of catheter infection among adult patients in intensive care unit who require arterial catheters, if treated with povidone iodine-alcohol""). This capability enables the system to identify clinical trials relevant to diagnostic/treatment hypotheses -- a clinician's or a CDSS's. Further, Clinical Evidence Engine can identify key parts of a clinical trial abstract, including patient population (e.g., adult patients in intensive care unit who require arterial catheters), intervention (povidone iodine-alcohol), and outcome (risks of catheter infection). This capability opens up the possibility of enabling clinicians to 1) rapidly determine the match between a clinical trial and a clinical question, and 2) understand the result and contexts of the trial without extensive reading. We demonstrate this potential by illustrating two example use scenarios of the system. We discuss the idea of designing DST explanations not as specific to a DST or an algorithm, but as a domain-agnostic decision support infrastructure.

Significant variability is detected on timescales from weeks to hours before reaching the background noise level. The $\sim$month-long, 30 minute-cadence, high-precision TESS light curve can be well fit by a simple damped random walk (DRW) model, with the damping timescale $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ constrained to be $2.3_{-0.7}^{+1.8}$~days ($1\sigma$). NGC 4395 lies almost exactly on the extrapolation of the $\tau_{\rm DRW}-M_{\rm BH}$ relation measured for AGNs with BH masses that are more than three orders of magnitude larger. The optical variability periodogram can be well fit by a broken power law with the high-frequency slope ($-1.88\pm0.15$) and the characteristic timescale ($\tau_{\rm br}\equiv 1/(2\pi f_{\rm br})=1.4_{-0.5}^{+1.9}\,$days) consistent with the DRW model within 1$\sigma$.

Direct atomic-level observations via scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that MPTMCs are composed of a single phase with a random distribution of all cations, which holds the key to the unique combinations of improved fracture toughness, superior Vickers hardness, and extremely lower thermal diffusivity achieved in MPTMCs.

The relative flux models are built with multivariate Skew-t distributions in the multi-dimensional space of relative fluxes as a function of redshift and magnitude. For 151,392 quasars in the SDSS, we achieve a photo-$z$ accuracy, defined as the fraction of quasars with the difference between the photo-$z$ $z_p$ and the spectroscopic redshift $z_s$, $|\Delta z| = |z_s-z_p|/(1+z_s)$ within 0.1, of 74%. Combining the WISE W1 and W2 infrared data with the SDSS data, the photo-$z$ accuracy is enhanced to 87%. Using the Pan-STARRS1 or DECaLS photometry with WISE W1 and W2 data, the photo-$z$ accuracies are 79% and 72%, respectively. The prior probabilities as a function of magnitude for quasars, stars and galaxies are calculated respectively based on (1) the quasar luminosity function; (2) the Milky Way synthetic simulation with the Besan\c{c}on model; (3) the Bayesian Galaxy Photometric Redshift estimation. The relative fluxes of stars are obtained with the Padova isochrones, and the relative fluxes of galaxies are modeled through galaxy templates.

The quasar selection completeness is higher than 70% for a wide redshift range $0.5<z<4.5$, and a wide magnitude range $18<r<21.5$ mag.

0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Neural Network Pruning,1970,"  Neural network pruning has been an essential technique to reduce the computation and memory requirements for using deep neural networks for resource-constrained devices. Most existing research focuses primarily on balancing the sparsity and accuracy of a pruned neural network by strategically removing insignificant parameters and retraining the pruned model. Such efforts on reusing training samples pose serious privacy risks due to increased memorization, which, however, has not been investigated yet.   In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of privacy risks in neural network pruning. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of neural network pruning on training data privacy, i.e., membership inference attacks. We first explore the impact of neural network pruning on prediction divergence, where the pruning process disproportionately affects the pruned model's behavior for members and non-members. Meanwhile, the influence of divergence even varies among different classes in a fine-grained manner. Enlighten by such divergence, we proposed a self-attention membership inference attack against the pruned neural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted to rigorously evaluate the privacy impacts of different pruning approaches, sparsity levels, and adversary knowledge. The proposed attack shows the higher attack performance on the pruned models when compared with eight existing membership inference attacks. In addition, we propose a new defense mechanism to protect the pruning process by mitigating the prediction divergence based on KL-divergence distance, whose effectiveness has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively mitigate the privacy risks while maintaining the sparsity and accuracy of the pruned models.

For example, heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) and Ultra dense network (UDN) have been proposed as promising techniques for 5G systems. Dense deployment of base stations (BSs) allows a mobile user to be able to access multiple BSs. Meanwhile the unbalance between UL and DL in HetNets, such as different received SINR threshold and traffic load, etc., becomes increasingly obvious. All these factors naturally inspire us to consider decoupling of uplink and downlink in radio access network. An interesting question is that whether the decoupled uplink (UL) /downlink (DL) access (DUDA) mode outperforms traditional coupled uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) access (CUDA) mode or not, and how big is the performance difference in terms of system rate, spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), etc. in HetNets. In this paper, we aim at thoroughly comparing the performance of the two modes based on stochastic geometry theory. In our analytical model, we take into account dynamic transmit power control in UL communication. Specifically, we employ fractional power control (FPC) to model a location-dependent channel state. Numerical results reveals that DUDA mode significantly outperforms CUDA mode in system rate, SE and EE in HetNets.

0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,Federated Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Knowledge Transfer,1970,"  Given the rapidly changing machine learning environments and expensive data labeling, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is imperative when the labeled data from the source domain is statistically different from the partially labeled data from the target domain. Most prior SSDA research is centrally performed, requiring access to both source and target data. However, data in many fields nowadays is generated by distributed end devices. Due to privacy concerns, the data might be locally stored and cannot be shared, resulting in the ineffectiveness of existing SSDA research. This paper proposes an innovative approach to achieve SSDA over multiple distributed and confidential datasets, named by Federated Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (FSSDA). FSSDA integrates SSDA with federated learning based on strategically designed knowledge distillation techniques, whose efficiency is improved by performing source and target training in parallel. Moreover, FSSDA controls the amount of knowledge transferred across domains by properly selecting a key parameter, i.e., the imitation parameter. Further, the proposed FSSDA can be effectively generalized to multi-source domain adaptation scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FSSDA design. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2207.10727v2,Yes,"innovative(1), strategically(1)"

Given the widespread yet heterogeneous devices nowadays, in this paper, we propose an innovative federated learning framework with heterogeneous on-device models through Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer, named by FedZKT. Specifically, FedZKT allows devices to independently determine the on-device models upon their local resources. To achieve knowledge transfer across these heterogeneous on-device models, a zero-shot distillation approach is designed without any prerequisites for private on-device data, which is contrary to certain prior research based on a public dataset or a pre-trained data generator. Moreover, this compute-intensive distillation task is assigned to the server to allow the participation of resource-constrained devices, where a generator is adversarially learned with the ensemble of collected on-device models. The distilled central knowledge is then sent back in the form of the corresponding on-device model parameters, which can be easily absorbed on the device side. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedZKT towards on-device knowledge agnostic, on-device model heterogeneity, and other challenging federated learning scenarios, such as heterogeneous on-device data and straggler effects.

0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,Towards Robust On-Ramp Merging via Augmented Multimodal Reinforcement   Learning,1970,"  Despite the success of AI-enabled onboard perception, on-ramp merging has been one of the main challenges for autonomous driving. Due to limited sensing range of onboard sensors, a merging vehicle can hardly observe main road conditions and merge properly. By leveraging the wireless communications between connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), a merging CAV has potential to proactively obtain the intentions of nearby vehicles. However, CAVs can be prone to inaccurate observations, such as the noisy basic safety messages (BSM) and poor quality surveillance images. In this paper, we present a novel approach for Robust on-ramp merge of CAVs via Augmented and Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning, named by RAMRL. Specifically, we formulate the on-ramp merging problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) by taking driving safety, comfort driving behavior, and traffic efficiency into account. To provide reliable merging maneuvers, we simultaneously leverage BSM and surveillance images for multi-modal observation, which is used to learn a policy model through proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, to improve data efficiency and provide better generalization performance, we train the policy model with augmented data (e.g., noisy BSM and noisy surveillance images). Extensive experiments are conducted with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform under two typical merging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our robust on-ramp merging design. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2208.07307v1,Yes,potent(1)
0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,CTS: A Consistency-Based Medical Image Segmentation Model,1970,"  In medical image segmentation tasks, diffusion models have shown significant potential. However, mainstream diffusion models suffer from drawbacks such as multiple sampling times and slow prediction results. Recently, consistency models, as a standalone generative network, have resolved this issue. Compared to diffusion models, consistency models can reduce the sampling times to once, not only achieving similar generative effects but also significantly speeding up training and prediction. However, they are not suitable for image segmentation tasks, and their application in the medical imaging field has not yet been explored. Therefore, this paper applies the consistency model to medical image segmentation tasks, designing multi-scale feature signal supervision modes and loss function guidance to achieve model convergence. Experiments have verified that the CTS model can obtain better medical image segmentation results with a single sampling during the test phase. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2405.09056v1,Yes,potent(1)

Recently, vertical FL, where the participants hold the same set of samples but with different features, has received increased attention. This paper first presents one label inference attack method to investigate the potential privacy leakages of the vertical logistic regression model. Specifically, we discover that the attacker can utilize the residue variables, which are calculated by solving the system of linear equations constructed by local dataset and the received decrypted gradients, to infer the privately owned labels. To deal with this, we then propose three protection mechanisms, e.g., additive noise mechanism, multiplicative noise mechanism, and hybrid mechanism which leverages local differential privacy and homomorphic encryption techniques, to prevent the attack and improve the robustness of the vertical logistic regression. model. Experimental results show that both the additive noise mechanism and the multiplicative noise mechanism can achieve efficient label protection with only a slight drop in model testing accuracy, furthermore, the hybrid mechanism can achieve label protection without any testing accuracy degradation, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our protection techniques ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2205.04166v1,Yes,potent(1)

However, this process carries a substantial risk of model misuse, potentially resulting in severe economic consequences for business owners. Thus, safeguarding the copyright of these customized models during LLM fine-tuning has become an urgent practical requirement, but there are limited existing solutions to provide such protection. To tackle this pressing issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach named ``Double-I watermark''. Specifically, based on the instruct-tuning data, two types of backdoor data paradigms are introduced with trigger in the instruction and the input, respectively. By leveraging LLM's learning capability to incorporate customized backdoor samples into the dataset, the proposed approach effectively injects specific watermarking information into the customized model during fine-tuning, which makes it easy to inject and verify watermarks in commercial scenarios. We evaluate the proposed ""Double-I watermark"" under various fine-tuning methods, demonstrating its harmlessness, robustness, uniqueness, imperceptibility, and validity through both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,BadFusion: 2D-Oriented Backdoor Attacks against 3D Object Detection,1970,"  3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving; however, its vulnerability to backdoor attacks has become evident. By injecting ''triggers'' to poison the training dataset, backdoor attacks manipulate the detector's prediction for inputs containing these triggers. Existing backdoor attacks against 3D object detection primarily poison 3D LiDAR signals, where large-sized 3D triggers are injected to ensure their visibility within the sparse 3D space, rendering them easy to detect and impractical in real-world scenarios.   In this paper, we delve into the robustness of 3D object detection, exploring a new backdoor attack surface through 2D cameras. Given the prevalent adoption of camera and LiDAR signal fusion for high-fidelity 3D perception, we investigate the latent potential of camera signals to disrupt the process. Although the dense nature of camera signals enables the use of nearly imperceptible small-sized triggers to mislead 2D object detection, realizing 2D-oriented backdoor attacks against 3D object detection is non-trivial. The primary challenge emerges from the fusion process that transforms camera signals into a 3D space, compromising the association with the 2D trigger to the target output. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative 2D-oriented backdoor attack against LiDAR-camera fusion methods for 3D object detection, named BadFusion, for preserving trigger effectiveness throughout the entire fusion process. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BadFusion, achieving a significantly higher attack success rate compared to existing 2D-oriented attacks.

However, disorder-free quantum many-body systems with local conservation can also exhibit AL or even many-body localization transition.

The occurrence of AL roots from quenched disorder formed by conservative localized moments. Interestingly, a many-body wavefunction is found, which captures elements in all three paramagnetic phases and is used to compute their quantum entanglement. In light of these findings, we expect the disorder-free AL phenomena can exit in generic translation-invariant quantum many-body systems.

However, existing SemCom research, primarily centered on simplified scenarios like single-pair transmissions with direct wireless links, faces significant challenges when applied to real-world radio access networks (RANs). This article introduces a Semantic-aware Radio Access Network (S-RAN), offering a holistic systematic view of SemCom beyond single-pair transmissions. We begin by outlining the S-RAN architecture, introducing new physical components and logical functions along with key design challenges. We then present transceiver design for end-to-end transmission to overcome conventional SemCom transceiver limitations, including static channel conditions, oversimplified background knowledge models, and hardware constraints. Later, we delve into the discussion on radio resource management for multiple users, covering semantic channel modeling, performance metrics, resource management algorithms, and a case study, to elaborate distinctions from resource management for legacy RANs. Finally, we highlight open research challenges and potential solutions. The objective of this article is to serve as a basis for advancing SemCom research into practical wireless systems.

We use the t-t$^\prime$-J model on the honeycomb lattice as our starting point and employ the slave-boson mean-field theory. In the antiferromagnetic normal state, the characteristic doping evolution of Fermi surface shows that only one effective singe band is active, which suggests that the potential pairing symmetry is the time-reversal symmetry breaking $d+id$, rather than the extended $s$-wave. It is found that this superconducting state coexists with the antiferromagnetism in a broad doping regime, which is consistent with the numerical calculations. The local density of states and its thermodynamic property of the superconducting state has been studied in detail with an effective single-band picture for understanding other physical observable such as superfluid density. The present work may be useful in experimentally exploring possible superconductivity of this kind of materials on the honeycomb lattice and contributes to the understanding of the unconventional superconductivity on general two-dimensional correlated electron systems.

0009-0007-4678-0419,Lan Zhang,The University of Manchester,Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication   Networks,1970,"  Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.

We first derive the spatial density distribution for stars of three abundance-selected sub-populations by accounting for the survey's selection function. The vertical profile of these sub-populations are simple exponentials and their vertical dispersion profile is nearly isothermal. To model these data, we apply the `vertical' Jeans Equation, which relates the observable tracer number density and vertical velocity dispersion to the gravitational potential or vertical force. We explore a number of functional forms for the vertical force law, and fit the dispersion and density profiles of all abundance selected sub-populations simultaneously in the same potential, and explore all parameter co-variances using MCMC. Our fits constrain a disk {\it mass} scale height $\lesssim$ 300 pc and the total surface mass density to be $67 \pm 6 M_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $|z| = 1.0$ kpc of which the contribution from all stars is $42 \pm 5 M_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-2}}$ (presuming a contribution from cold gas of $13 M_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-2}}$). We find significant constraints on the local dark matter density of $0.0065\pm0.0023 M_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-3}}$ ($0.25\pm0.09 {\rm GeV cm^{-3}} $). Together with recent experiments this firms up the best estimate of $0.0075\pm0.0021 M_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-3}}$ ($0.28\pm0.08 {\rm GeV cm^{-3}} $), consistent with global fits of approximately round dark matter halos to kinematic data in the outskirts of the Galaxy.

Input filtering is a promising approach to eliminate the redundancy so as to reduce the cost of inference. Previous efforts have tailored effective solutions for many applications, but left two essential questions unanswered: (1) theoretical filterability of an inference workload to guide the application of input filtering techniques, thereby avoiding the trial-and-error cost for resource-constrained mobile applications; (2) robust discriminability of feature embedding to allow input filtering to be widely effective for diverse inference tasks and input content. To answer them, we first formalize the input filtering problem and theoretically compare the hypothesis complexity of inference models and input filters to understand the optimization potential. Then we propose the first end-to-end learnable input filtering framework that covers most state-of-the-art methods and surpasses them in feature embedding with robust discriminability. We design and implement InFi that supports six input modalities and multiple mobile-centric deployments. Comprehensive evaluations confirm our theoretical results and show that InFi outperforms strong baselines in applicability, accuracy, and efficiency.

High-resolution spectroscopic observations made with the MIKE instrument on the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope for nine stars are added to the previous sample analyzed by Zhang et al. (2017). We compile a sample of fifteen young stars with well-determined stellar types, ages, abundances and kinematics. With proper motions from Gaia DR2 we also derive orbits in a realistic Milky-Way potential. We find that our previous radial-velocity selected LA candidates have substantial orbital angular momentum. The substantial amount of rotational component for these stars is in contrast with the near-polar Magellanic orbit, thus rendering these stars unlikely members of the LA. There are four large orbital-energy stars in our sample. The highest orbital-energy one has an age shorter than the time to disk crossing, with a birthplace $z=2.5$~kpc and $R_{\rm GC}\sim 28$~kpc. Therefore, the origin of this star is uncertain. The remaining three stars have disk runaway origin with birthplaces between 12 and 25 kpc from the Galactic center. Also, the most energetic stars are more metal poor ([Mg/H] =$-0.50\pm0.07$) and with larger He scatter ($\sigma_{\rm [He/H]} = 0.72$) than the inner disk ones ([Mg/H] $=0.12\pm0.36$, $\sigma_{\rm [He/H]} = 0.15$). While the former group's abundance is compatible with that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it could also reflect the metallicity gradient of the MW disk and their runaway status via different runaway mechanisms.

Post's Correspondence Problem for a group $\Gamma$ takes pairs of group homomorphisms $g, h\colon F(\Sigma)\to \Gamma$ instead, and similarly asks whether there exists an $x$ such that $g(x)=h(x)$ holds for non-elementary reasons.

A basin-wide spatial average of backward FTLE is calculated for the GoF for the first time. This measure of the mixing strength displays a clear seasonal pattern. The evaluated backward FTLE features are linked with potential patch formation regions with high FTC levels. It is shown that areas hosting frequent upwelling or downwelling have consistently stronger than average mixing intensity.

Finding practical approaches for checking the security of network protocol implementations has proven to be a challenging problem. The main reason is that the protocol software state-space is too large to be explored. Here we propose a novel verification approach that combines fuzzing with symbolic execution to verify intricate properties in network protocol implementations. We use fuzzing for an initial exploration of the network protocol, while symbolic execution explores both the program paths and protocol states, which were uncovered by fuzzing.

We surveyed various approaches based on fuzzing and symbolic execution to understand how these techniques can be effectively combined and then choose a suitable tool to develop further our model on top of it.

We show that the topological $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid phase can be realized in a single-component dipolar Fermi gas trapped in a 2D square optical lattice with this attractive interaction at low temperatures. The $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid state has potential applications for topological quantum computing. We obtain the phase diagram of this system at zero temperature. In the weak-coupling limit, the p-wave superfluid phase is stable for all filling factors. As the interaction strength increases, it is stable close to filling factors $n=0$ or $n=1$, and phase separation takes place in between. When the interaction strength is above a threshold, the system is phase separated for any $0<n<1$. The transition temperature of the $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid state is estimated and the implication for experiments is discussed. ",https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.031603,1202.4924v2,Yes,potent(1)

Especially in such robotics tasks, sample efficiency is of the utmost importance for GCRL since, by default, the agent is only rewarded when it reaches its goal. While several methods have been proposed to improve the sample efficiency of GCRL, one relatively under-studied approach is the design of neural architectures to support sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce a novel neural architecture for GCRL that achieves significantly better sample efficiency than the commonly-used monolithic network architecture. The key insight is that the optimal action-value function Q^*(s, a, g) must satisfy the triangle inequality in a specific sense. Furthermore, we introduce the metric residual network (MRN) that deliberately decomposes the action-value function Q(s,a,g) into the negated summation of a metric plus a residual asymmetric component. MRN provably approximates any optimal action-value function Q^*(s,a,g), thus making it a fitting neural architecture for GCRL. We conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 standard benchmark environments in GCRL. The empirical results demonstrate that MRN uniformly outperforms other state-of-the-art GCRL neural architectures in terms of sample efficiency. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2208.08133v4,Yes,potent(1)

However, it was observed experimentally that the (necessarily quantum) ""branched flow"" pattern of electron flux from a quantum point contact (QPC) traveling over a random background potential in two-dimensional electron gases(2DEGs) remains substantially invariant to large changes in initial conditions. Since such a potential is classically chaotic and unstable to changes in initial conditions, it was conjectured that the origin of the observed stability is purely quantum mechanical, with no classical analog. In this paper, we show that the observed stability is a result of the physics of the QPC and the nature of the experiment. We show that the same stability can indeed be reproduced classically, or quantum mechanically. In addition, we explore the stability of the branched flow with regards to changes in the eigenmodes of quantum point contact.

It is not only interesting for understanding the concept of chirality, but also important for potential applications in spintronics. Past studies show that chiral magnets require both lack of the inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling to induce the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction.

By means of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculation, we demonstrate that the chiral orbital magnetism can be found when considering bosonic atoms loaded in the $p$-band of an optical lattice in the Mott regime.

This paper presents a spatial and semantic modulated deep network framework for object co-segmentation. A backbone network is adopted to extract multi-resolution image features. With the multi-resolution features of the relevant images as input, we design a spatial modulator to learn a mask for each image. The spatial modulator captures the correlations of image feature descriptors via unsupervised learning. The learned mask can roughly localize the shared foreground object while suppressing the background. For the semantic modulator, we model it as a supervised image classification task. We propose a hierarchical second-order pooling module to transform the image features for classification use. The outputs of the two modulators manipulate the multi-resolution features by a shift-and-scale operation so that the features focus on segmenting co-object regions. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any intricate post-processing.

Here we report that the combination of anharmonicity of trapping potential and spin-orbit coupling will provide a new paradigm to achieve supersolids. By means of imaginary time evolution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we demonstrate that a supersolid state can be found when considering a trapped Rashba-type spin-orbit coupled bosonic atoms loaded in a one-dimensional optical lattice.

Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for understanding the roles of miRNA in biological processes that are potentially involved in complex diseases. Statistical methodologies for point estimation, such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm, have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose using the Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO) and the non-negative Bayesian LASSO (nBLASSO) to analyse the interactions between miRNA and mRNA using expression data. The proposed Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters required to model the miRNA-mRNA interactions. These approaches can be used to observe the inferred effects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the posterior distributions of those parameters. For comparison purposes, the Least Squares Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO (nLASSO), and the proposed Bayesian approaches were applied to four public datasets. We concluded that nLASSO and nBLASSO perform best in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Compared to the point estimate algorithms, which only provide single estimates for those parameters, the Bayesian methods are more meaningful and provide credible intervals, which take into account the uncertainty of the inferred interactions of the miRNA and mRNA. Furthermore, Bayesian methods naturally provide statistical significance to select convincing inferred interactions, while point estimate algorithms require a manually chosen threshold, which is less meaningful, to choose the possible interactions.

Classical static navigation methods require environment-specific in-situ system adjustment, e.g. from human experts, or may repeat their mistakes regardless of how many times they have navigated in the same environment. Having the potential to improve with experience, learning-based navigation is highly dependent on access to training resources, e.g. sufficient memory and fast computation, and is prone to forgetting previously learned capability, especially when facing different environments.

Vehicle-based crowdsourcing offers a promising approach for updating HD maps. However, recruiting crowdsourcing vehicles involves making the challenging tradeoff between the HD map freshness and recruitment costs. Existing studies on HD map crowdsourcing often (1) prioritize maximizing spatial coverage and (2) overlook the dual role of crowdsourcing vehicles in HD maps, as vehicles serve both as contributors and customers of HD maps. This motivates us to propose the Dual-Role Age of Information (AoI) based Incentive Mechanism (DRAIM) to address these issues. % Specifically, we propose the trajectory age of information, incorporating the expected AoI of the HD map and the trajectory, to quantify a vehicle's HD map usage utility, which is freshness- and trajectory-dependent.

We argue that research in this area should be expressed in this framework in addition to providing a standardized environment for repeatability. Advanced controllers such as model predictive control and reinforcement learning (RL) control have both advantages and disadvantages that prevent them from being implemented in real world problems. Comparisons between the two are rare, and often biased. By focusing on the challenges, we can investigate the performance of the controllers under a variety of situations and generate a fair comparison. As a demonstration, we implement the offline learning challenge in CityLearn and study the impact of different levels of domain knowledge and complexity of RL algorithms. We show that the sequence of operations utilized in a rule based controller (RBC) used for offline training affects the performance of the RL agents when evaluated on a set of four energy flexibility metrics. Longer offline learning from an optimized RBC leads to improved performance in the long run. RL agents that learn from a simplified RBC risk poorer performance as the offline learning period increases. We also observe no impact on performance from information sharing amongst agents.

To instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine learning algorithms' explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example, existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances.

We observe that the addition of electrolytes such as HClO4, despite increasing conductivity, significantly reduces energy conversion efficiency by inhibiting bubble coalescence. A phase diagram illustrates the trade-off between improved conductivity and inhibition of coalescence with varying concentrations of supporting electrolytes (HClO4 or Na2SO4) at different electrolysis current. Contrary to conventional understanding, we find that larger bubbles resulting from coalescence enhance efficiency. This can be attributed to the early release of smaller bubbles, approximately 10 micron in size, facilitated by the coalescence of the surface microbubble and the just-detached large bubble. Additionally, the merge of two bubbles, at a critical velocity of ~2 m/s, enhances agitation at the electrode surface that significantly improves electrolyte transport within the stagnant layer. These findings challenge conventional perspectives on bubble detachment size and suggest innovative approaches to optimize energy consumption in electrolysis, especially in systems where the bubble coalescence is inhibited, such as alkaline water electrolysis and the chlor-alkali industry.

To address this issue, we develop an effective spatiotemporal feature alignment network tailored to VSP, mainly including two key sub-networks: a multi-scale deformable convolutional alignment network (MDAN) and a bidirectional convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-ConvLSTM) network. The MDAN learns to align the features of the neighboring frames to the reference one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can well handle various motions. Specifically, the MDAN owns a pyramidal feature hierarchy structure that first leverages deformable convolution (Dconv) to align the lower-resolution features across frames, and then aggregates the aligned features to align the higher-resolution features, progressively enhancing the features from top to bottom. The output of MDAN is then fed into the Bi-ConvLSTM for further enhancement, which captures the useful long-time temporal information along forward and backward timing directions to effectively guide attention orientation shift prediction under complex scene transformation. Finally, the enhanced features are decoded to generate the predicted saliency map. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any intricate post processing.

How to generate pseudo labels for unseen-class samples and how to use such usually noisy pseudo labels are two critical issues in transductive learning. In this work, we introduce an iterative co-training framework which contains two different base ZSL models and an exchanging module. At each iteration, the two different ZSL models are co-trained to separately predict pseudo labels for the unseen-class samples, and the exchanging module exchanges the predicted pseudo labels, then the exchanged pseudo-labeled samples are added into the training sets for the next iteration. By such, our framework can gradually boost the ZSL performance by fully exploiting the potential complementarity of the two models' classification capabilities. In addition, our co-training framework is also applied to the generalized ZSL (GZSL), in which a semantic-guided OOD detector is proposed to pick out the most likely unseen-class samples before class-level classification to alleviate the bias problem in GZSL.

Using the Wilson renormalization method to account for high-band effects, we study the low-energy two-body scattering processes of spin-$1/2$ fermions in spin-orbit coupled optical lattices. We demonstrate that, under weak SOC, adding a small lattice potential would destabilize shallow two-body bound states, contrary to conventional wisdom. On the other hand, when lattice is sufficiently deep, two-body bound states are always stabilized by increasing the lattice depth. This intriguing non-monotonic behavior of the bound-state stability derives from the competition between SOC and optical lattices, and can be explained by analyzing the low-energy density of states.

0000-0003-2591-3888,Laurent Binet,Universit辿 PSL,"Structure, composition, and location of organic matter in the enstatite   chondrite Sahara 97096 (EH3)",1970,"  The insoluble organic matter (IOM) of an unequilibrated enstatite chondrite Sahara (SAH) 97096 has been investigated using a battery of analytical techniques. As the enstatite chondrites are thought to have formed in a reduced environment at higher temperatures than carbonaceous chondrites, they constitute an interesting comparative material to test the heterogeneities of the IOM in the solar system and to constrain the processes that could affect IOM during solar system evolution. The SAH 97096 IOM is found in situ: as submicrometer grains in the network of fine-grained matrix occurring mostly around chondrules and as inclusions in metallic nodules, where the carbonaceous matter appears to be more graphitized. IOM in these two settings has very similar $\delta^{15}N$ and $\delta^{13}C$; this supports the idea that graphitized inclusions in metal could be formed by metal catalytic graphitization of matrix IOM. A detailed comparison between the IOM extracted from a fresh part and a terrestrially weathered part of SAH 97096 shows the similarity between both IOM samples in spite of the high degree of mineral alteration in the latter. The isolated IOM exhibits a heterogeneous polyaromatic macromolecular structure, sometimes highly graphitized, without any detectable free radicals and deuterium-heterogeneity and having mean H- and N-isotopic compositions in the range of values observed for carbonaceous chondrites. It contains some submicrometer-sized areas highly enriched in $^{15}N$ ($\delta^{15}N$ up to 1600 permil). These observations reinforce the idea that the IOM found in carbonaceous chondrites is a common component widespread in the solar system. Most of the features of SAH 97096 IOM could be explained by the thermal modification of this main component. ",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01306.x,1502.00216v1,Yes,fresh(1)

However, survey data collection can be arduous, time-consuming, and expensive, with no assurance of an adequate response rate. In this paper, we propose a pioneering approach for predicting survey responses by examining quotations using machine learning. Our investigation focuses on evaluating the degree of favorability towards the United States, a topic of interest to many organizations and governments. We leverage a vast corpus of quotations from individuals across different nationalities and time periods to extract their level of favorability. We employ a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to construct a predictive model for survey responses. We investigate two scenarios: first, when no surveys have been conducted in a country, and second when surveys have been conducted but in specific years and do not cover all the years. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can predict survey responses with high accuracy. Furthermore, we provide an exhaustive analysis of the crucial features that contributed to the model's performance. This study has the potential to impact survey research in the field of data science by substantially decreasing the cost and time required to conduct surveys while simultaneously providing accurate predictions of public opinion.

0000-0002-6229-9103,Alireza Amirshahi,EPFL,MetaWearS: A Shortcut in Wearable Systems Lifecycle with Only a Few   Shots,1970,"  Wearable systems provide continuous health monitoring and can lead to early detection of potential health issues. However, the lifecycle of wearable systems faces several challenges. First, effective model training for new wearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects collected directly by the wearable. Second, subsequent model updates require further extensive labeled data for retraining. Finally, frequent model updating on the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data monitoring. Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a meta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required. Moreover, our approach incorporates a prototypical updating mechanism, simplifying the update process by modifying the class prototype rather than retraining the entire model. We explore the performance of MetaWearS in two case studies, namely, the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation. We show that by fine-tuning with just a few samples, we achieve 70% and 82% AUC for the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of atrial fibrillation, respectively. Compared to a conventional approach, our proposed method performs better with up to 45% AUC. Furthermore, updating the model with only 16 minutes of additional labeled data increases the AUC by up to 5.3%. Finally, MetaWearS reduces the energy consumption for model updates by 456x and 418x for epileptic seizure and AF detection, respectively. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2408.01988v1,Yes,potent(1)

We engineer and study a cold-atom analog of a mesoscopic conductor. It consists of a narrow channel connecting two macroscopic reservoirs of fermions that can be switched from ballistic to diffusive. We induce a current through the channel and find ohmic conduction, even for a ballistic channel. An analysis of in-situ density distributions shows that in the ballistic case the chemical potential drop occurs at the entrance and exit of the channel, revealing the presence of contact resistance. In contrast, a diffusive channel with disorder displays a chemical potential drop spread over the whole channel.

We measure the atomic current and extract the resistance of the film in a two-terminal configuration, and identify a superfluid state at low disorder strength, which evolves into a normal, poorly conducting state for strong disorder. The transition takes place when the chemical potential reaches the percolation threshold of the disorder. The evolution of the conduction properties contrasts with the smooth behavior of the density and compressibility across the transition, measured in-situ at equilibrium. These features suggest the emergence of a glass-like phase at strong disorder. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1211.7272v1,Yes,potent(2)

Transport experiments, in particular, have expanded to the point that conductances and other transport coefficients can now be measured in a way directly analogous to solid state physics, extending cold atoms based quantum simulations into the domain of quantum electronic devices.

We present the experimental techniques and the main experimental findings, focusing on but not restricted to the recent experiments performed in our group. We eventually discuss the perspectives opened by this approach, the main technical and conceptual challenges for future developments, and the potential applications as a quantum simulator for transport phenomena and mesoscopic physics problems.

Our method is based on standard absorption imaging, but takes advantage of the strong light-shift of the excited state of the imaging transition, which is due to a quasi-resonance of the trapping laser with a higher excited level. We use this method to (i) map the equipotentials of a crossed optical-dipole trap, and (ii) study the thermalisation of an atomic cloud by following the evolution of the potential-energy of atoms during the free-evaporation process.

The atomic current in the channel is controlled using a repulsive potential created by an off-resonant laser beam. In analogy with an electronic field-effect transistor, this gate potential controls the chemical potential in the channel while keeping the temperature imposed by the reservoirs unchanged. With the gate potential as a control parameter, we measure the current through the channel over a large dynamic range and determine the density distribution in the channel region. This allows us to observe the onset of superfluid flow of strongly interacting fermions. These measurements are compared to the case of a weakly interacting Fermi gas.

The controlled setting of cold atom experiments provides a new avenue to address these challenges [1], complementing studies in solid state physics, where a number of puzzling findings have emerged in experiments using superconducting thin films [2,3]. Here we investigate a strongly interacting thin film of an atomic Fermi gas subject to a random potential. We use high-resolution in-situ imaging [4-7] to resolve the atomic density at the length scale of a single impurity, which would require scanning probe techniques in solid state physics [8]. This allows us to directly observe the fragmentation of the density profile and to extract its percolation properties. Transport measurements in a two-terminal configuration indicate that the fragmentation process is accompanied by a breakdown of superfluidity. Our results suggest that percolation of paired atoms is responsible for the loss of superfluidity, and that disorder is able to increase the binding energy of pairs.

The perhaps most famous of these systems is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. It features maximal scrambling of quantum information, and opens a potential inroad to experimentally investigating aspects of quantum gravity. A scalable laboratory realisation of this model, however, remains outstanding. Here, we propose a feasible implementation of the SYK model in cavity quantum electrodynamics platforms. Through detailed analytical and numerical demonstrations, we show how driving a cloud of fermionic atoms trapped in a multi-mode optical cavity, and subjecting it to a spatially disordered AC-Stark shift retrieves the physics of the SYK model, with random all-to-all interactions and fast scrambling. Our work provides a blueprint for realising the SYK model in a scalable system, with the prospect of studying holographic quantum matter in the laboratory.

0000-0002-4610-6682,Jean-Philippe Brantut,EPFL,Observation of Quantized Conductance in Neutral Matter,1970,"  In transport experiments the quantum nature of matter becomes directly evident when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size determined solely by Planck's constant h. The observations of quantized steps in the electric conductance have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We employ high resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two adjustable reservoirs of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum. For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data and the Landauer formula, with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic device and can be readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases.

This yields the spin and particle conductance of the point contact as a function of chemical potential or confinement. The measurements cover a regime from weak attraction, where quantized conductance is observed, to the resonantly interacting superfluid. Spin conductance exhibits a broad maximum when varying the chemical potential at moderate interactions, which signals the emergence of Cooper pairing. In contrast, the particle conductance is unexpectedly enhanced even before the gas is expected to turn into a superfluid, continuously rising from the plateau at 1/h for weak interactions to plateaux-like features at non-universal values as high as 4/h for intermediate interactions. For strong interactions, the particle conductance plateaux disappear and the spin conductance gets suppressed, confirming the spin-insulating character of a superfluid. Our observations document the breakdown of universal conductance quantization as many-body correlations appear. The observed anomalous quantization challenges a Fermi liquid description of the normal phase, shedding new light on the nature of the strongly attractive Fermi gases.

0000-0002-4610-6682,Jean-Philippe Brantut,EPFL,Breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a unitary Fermi gas,1970,"  We report on coupled heat and particle transport measurements through a quantum point contact (QPC) connecting two reservoirs of resonantly interacting, finite temperature Fermi gases. After heating one of them, we observe a particle current flowing from cold to hot. We monitor the temperature evolution of the reservoirs and find that the system evolves after an initial response into a non-equilibrium steady state with finite temperature and chemical potential differences across the QPC. In this state any relaxation in the form of heat and particle currents vanishes. From our measurements we extract the transport coefficients of the QPC and deduce a Lorenz number violating the Wiedemann-Franz law by one order of magnitude, a characteristic persisting even for a wide contact. In contrast, the Seebeck coefficient takes a value close to that expected for a non-interacting Fermi gas and shows a smooth decrease as the atom density close to the QPC is increased beyond the superfluid transition. Our work represents a fermionic analog of the fountain effect observed with superfluid helium and poses new challenges for microscopic modeling of the finite temperature dynamics of the unitary Fermi gas.

Its potential would be further unveiled if it could be deposited in three dimensional (3D) architectures of sizes down to the nanometer. Atomic Layer Deposition, ALD, is the technique of choice for covering arbitrary shapes with homogeneous thin films. Early successes with ferromagnetic materials include nickel and cobalt. Still, challenges in depositing ferromagnetic alloys reside in the synthesis via decomposing the consituent elements at the same temperature and homogeneously.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations for both the dominant galaxy and the arc. The mass distribution in A3408 is modeled by scaled versions of the representative distributions derived from studies of clusters at higher redshifts. The two gravitational potentials considered are: i) a ``minimum'' mass case where the mass distribution follows the light profile of the central elliptical galaxy and, ii) a ``maximum'' mass case where a typical massive dark halo is added to the previous case. The observed arc is well reproduced by both models, but rather small magnifications of the source galaxy are implied. The source galaxy is tentatively identified in both the lensing and non-lensing scenarios as being a spiral. The smaller lensed spiral (14.6 h_50^{-1} kpc, M_B=-18.2) predicted by the dark halo model appears to fit the observations marginally better. Furthermore, we found that only the dark halo model predicts a measurable amount of weak shear in the images of faint background galaxies. We conclude that observations, under very good seeing conditions, of week shear in faint background galaxies in the direction of low-redshift galaxy clusters are possible. When the latter are combined with X-ray data, a powerful tool to probe the mass distribution in the very central region of galaxy clusters emerges.

Expanding on earlier work, the expected microlensing signal for two massive clusters, A2218 & A370 is calculated. It is found that the microlensing signal depends sensitively upon the mix of smooth and compact dark matter in the cluster. Comparison of two deep exposures taken with James Webb Space Telescope or two hour long exposures taken with a 30-metre class telescope in two epochs separated by a few years will possibly detect about a few dozen pixels which show strong variability due to microlensing at five sigma level, revealing wealth of information on the microlensing population.

Astrobots differ from conventional two-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators in two respects. First, the dense formation of astrobots give rise to the extremely overlapping dynamics of neighboring astrobots which make them severely subject to collisions. Second, the structure of astrobots and their mechanical specifications are specialized due to the embedded optical fibers passed through them. We focus on the coordination problem of astrobots whose solutions shall be collision-free, fast execution, and complete in terms of the astrobots' convergence rates.

They reveal a large number of luminous MIR sources. Optical and near-infrared (NIR) cross-identification suggests that almost all 15 microns sources and about half of the 7 microns are identified with distant lensed galaxies. Thanks to the gravitational amplification these sources constitute the faintest MIR sources detected. We confirm that the number counts derived at 15 microns show a clear excess of sources with respect to the predictions of a no-evolution model.   The possible extension of the NGST instrumentation from the near-IR (1-5 microns) to the thermal infrared, up to 20 microns (as suggested by the NGST task group report, October 1997) would permit study of this new population of dust-enshrouded AGN/starburst galaxies detected by ISOCAM, up to very high redshifts and with vastly improved spatial resolution. The existence of this population demonstrats that the discrimination of dust contributions, possible in the MIR, must be an important consideration in reaching an understanding of the Universe at high redshift.

Local anisotropies in the shear maps are assumed to arise from dark matter substructure within these clusters. Associating the substructure with bright early-type cluster galaxies, we quantify the properties of typical $L^*$ cluster members in a statistical fashion. The fraction of total mass associated with individual galaxies within the inner regions of these clusters ranges from 10--20% implying that the bulk of the dark matter in massive lensing clusters is smoothly distributed. Looking at the properties of the cluster galaxies, we find strong evidence ($>3$-$\sigma$ significance) that a fiducial early-type $L^\ast$ galaxy in these clusters has a mass distribution that is tidally truncated compared to equivalent luminosity galaxies in the field. In fact, we exclude field galaxy scale dark halos for these cluster early-types at $>10$-$\sigma$ significance. We compare the tidal radii obtained from this lensing analysis with the central density of the cluster potentials and find a correlation which is in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations of tidal truncation: $\log [r_t*] \propto (-0.6\pm 0.2) \log [\rho_0]$.

Strong Lensing modelling,1970,"  We propose a novel technique to refine the modelling of galaxy clusters mass distribution using gravitational lensing. The idea is to combine the strengths of both ""parametric"" and ""non-parametric"" methods to improve the quality of the fit. We develop a multi-scale model that allows sharper contrast in regions of higher density where the number of constraints is generally higher. Our model consists of (i) a multi-scale grid of radial basis functions with physically motivated profiles and (ii) a list of galaxy-scale potentials at the location of the cluster member galaxies. This arrangement of potentials of different sizes allows to reach a high resolution for the model with a minimum number of parameters. We apply our model to the well studied cluster Abell 1689. We estimate the quality of our mass reconstruction with a Bayesian MCMC sampler. For a selected subset of multiple images, we manage to halve the errors between the predicted and observed image positions compared to previous studies.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Cosmological Constraints From Weak Lensing Peak Statistics With CFHT   Stripe 82 Survey,1970,"  We derived constraints on cosmological parameters using weak lensing peak statistics measured on the $\sim130~{\rm deg}^2$ of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey (CS82). This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using peak statistics in cosmological studies. For our measurements, we considered peaks with signal-to-noise ratio in the range of $\nu=[3,6]$. For a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with only $(\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8)$ as free parameters, we constrained the parameters of the following relation $\Sigma_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.27)^{\alpha}$ to be: $\Sigma_8=0.82 \pm 0.03 $ and $\alpha=0.43\pm 0.02$. The $\alpha$ value found is considerably smaller than the one measured in two-point and three-point cosmic shear correlation analyses, showing a significant complement of peak statistics to standard weak lensing cosmological studies. The derived constraints on $(\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8)$ are fully consistent with the ones from either WMAP9 or Planck. From the weak lensing peak abundances alone, we obtained marginalised mean values of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.38^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and $\sigma_8=0.81\pm 0.26$. Finally, we also explored the potential of using weak lensing peak statistics to constrain the mass-concentration relation of dark matter halos simultaneously with cosmological parameters.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Systematic or Signal? How dark matter misalignments can bias strong   lensing models of galaxy clusters,1970,"  We explore how assuming that mass traces light in strong gravitational lensing models can lead to systematic errors in the predicted position of multiple images. Using a model based on the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416 (z = 0.397) from the Hubble Frontier Fields, we split each galactic halo into a baryonic and dark matter component. We then shift the dark matter halo such that it no longer aligns with the baryonic halo and investigate how this affects the resulting position of multiple images. We find for physically motivated misalignments in dark halo position, ellipticity, position angle and density profile, that multiple images can move on average by more than 0.2"" with individual images moving greater than 1"". We finally estimate the full error induced by assuming that light traces mass and find that this assumption leads to an expected RMS error of 0.5"", almost the entire error budget observed in the Frontier Fields. Given the large potential contribution from the assumption that light traces mass to the error budget in mass reconstructions, we predict that it should be possible to make a first significant detection and characterisation of dark halo misalignments in the Hubble Frontier Fields with strong lensing. Finally, we find that it may be possible to detect ~1kpc offsets between dark matter and baryons, the smoking gun for self-interacting dark matter, should the correct alignment of multiple images be observed.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Experimental evaluation of complete safe coordination of astrobots for   Sloan Digital Sky Survey V,1970,"  The data throughput of massive spectroscopic surveys in the course of each observation is directly coordinated with the number of optical fibers which reach their target. In this paper, we evaluate the safety and the performance of the astrobots coordination in SDSS-V by conducting various experimental and simulated tests. We illustrate that our strategy provides a complete coordination condition which depends on the operational characteristics of astrobots, their configurations, and their targets. Namely, a coordination method based on the notion of cooperative artificial potential fields is used to generate safe and complete trajectories for astrobots. Optimal target assignment further improves the performance of the used algorithm in terms of faster convergences and less oscillatory movements. Both random targets and galaxy catalog targets are employed to observe the coordination success of the algorithm in various target distributions. The proposed method is capable of handling all potential collisions in the course of coordination. Once the completeness condition is fulfilled according to initial configuration of astrobots and their targets, the algorithm reaches full convergence of astrobots. Should one assign targets to astrobots using efficient strategies, convergence time as well as the number of oscillations decrease in the course of coordination. Rare incomplete scenarios are simply resolved by trivial modifications of astrobots swarms' parameters. ",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10686-020-09687-4,2012.10656v1,Yes,potent(2)
0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,PINION: Physics-informed neural network for accelerating radiative   transfer simulations for cosmic reionization,1970,"  With the advent of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), scientists will be able to directly observe the Epoch of Reionization by mapping the distribution of neutral hydrogen at different redshifts. While physically motivated results can be simulated with radiative transfer codes, these simulations are computationally expensive and can not readily produce the required scale and resolution simultaneously. Here we introduce the Physics-Informed neural Network for reIONization (PINION), which can accurately and swiftly predict the complete 4-D hydrogen fraction evolution from the smoothed gas and mass density fields from pre-computed N-body simulation. We trained PINION on the C$^2$-Ray simulation outputs and a physics constraint on the reionization chemistry equation is enforced. With only five redshift snapshots and a propagation mask as a simplistic approximation of the ionizing photon mean free path, PINION can accurately predict the entire reionization history between $z=6$ and $12$. We evaluate the accuracy of our predictions by analysing the dimensionless power spectra and morphology statistics estimations against C$^2$-Ray results. We show that while the network's predictions are in good agreement with simulation to redshift $z>7$, the network's accuracy suffers for $z<7$ primarily due to the oversimplified propagation mask. We motivate how PINION performance can be drastically improved and potentially generalized to large-scale simulations. ",https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad615,2208.13803v2,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,An HST Lensing Survey of X-ray Luminous Galaxy Clusters: I. A383,1970,"  We analyse the mass distribution in the core of A383 (z=0.188), one of 12 X-ray luminous clusters at z~0.2 selected for a comprehensive and unbiased study of the mass distribution in massive clusters. Deep HST imaging reveals a wide variety of gravitationally lensed features in A383, including a giant arc formed from the strongly-lensed images of 2 background galaxies, 2 radial arcs, several multiply-imaged arcs and numerous arclets. Based upon the constraints from the various lensed features, we construct a detailed mass model for the central regions of the cluster, taking into account both the cluster-scale potential and perturbations from individual cluster galaxies. Keck spectroscopy of one component of the giant arc identifies it as a star-forming galaxy at z=1.01 and provides an accurate measurement of the cluster mass within the radius of the giant arc (65kpc) of (3.5+/-0.1)*10^13 Mo. Using the weak shear measured from our HST observations we extend our mass model to determine a mass of (1.8+/-0.2)*10^14 Mo within a radius of 250kpc. On smaller scales we employ the radial arcs as probes of the shape of the mass distribution in the cluster core (r<20kpc), and find that the mass profile is more peaked than a single NFW profile. The optical and X-ray properties of A383 indicate the presence of a central cooling flow, for which we derive a mass deposition rate of >200 Mo/yr. We also use the X-ray emission from A383 to obtain independent estimates of the total mass within projected radii of 65 and 250kpc: (4.0+/-1.4)*10^13 Mo and (1.2+/-0.5)*10^14 Mo, which are consistent with the lensing measurements.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,COSMOS: 3D weak lensing and the growth of structure,1970,"  We present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed in space. We have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as a function of redshift. Using both 2D and 3D analyses, we measure cosmological parameters Omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, the normalization of the matter power spectrum. The introduction of redshift information tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces the relative sampling (or ""cosmic"") variance compared to recent surveys that may be larger but are only two dimensional. From the 3D analysis, we find sigma_8*(Omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits, including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in the total budget. Indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods is now the dominant source of uncertainty. Assuming instead a baseline cosmology to fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structure on both linear and non-linear physical scales. Our results thus demonstrate a proof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposed for future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from those galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. The observed galaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes must be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution and noise. The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting Program (STEP). Via STEP, we have run challenges within our own community, and come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally matched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computational learning. Thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we are seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. This document details the GREAT08 Challenge for potential participants.

The survey has yielded 10 z-band and 2 J-band drop-out candidates to photometric limits of J_110~=26.2 AB (5sigma). Taking into account the magnifications afforded by our clusters (1-4 magnitudes), we probe the presence of z>7 sources to unlensed limits of J_{110}~=30 AB, fainter than those charted in the Hubble Ultradeep Field. To verify the fidelity of our candidates we conduct a number of tests for instrumental effects which would lead to spurious detections, and carefully evaluate the likelihood of foreground contamination by considering photometric uncertainties in the drop-out signature, the upper limits from stacked IRAC data and the statistics of multiply-imaged sources. Overall, we conclude that we can expect about half of our sample of z-band drop-outs are likely to be at high redshift. An ambitious infrared spectroscopic campaign undertaken with the NIRSPEC spectrograph at the WM Keck Observatory for seven of the most promising candidates failed to detect any Lyman-alpha emission highlighting the challenge of making further progress in this field. While the volume density of high redshift sources will likely remain uncertain until more powerful facilities are available, our data provides the first potentially interesting constraints on the UV luminosity function at z~=7.5 at intrinsically faint limits. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of the hypothesis that the bulk of the reionizing photons in the era 7<z<12 arise in low luminosity galaxies undetected by conventional surveys.

Mass & Light in SL2S J08544-0121, a Galaxy Group at z=0.35",1970,"  Precise modelling of strong lensing systems can be affected by external mass distributions, e.g. the group or cluster within which the lens is embedded. In this article, we propose to turn this limitation to our advantage and to use precise strong lensing modelling to probe external mass distributions surrounding the lens. We consider SL2S J08544-0121, a galaxy group at z=0.35 that contains a strong lensing system. A simple elliptical isothermal potential cannot reproduce satisfactorily the strong lensing constraints. We include an external mass perturbation corresponding to the group within which the lens is embedded. The lensing properties of this perturbation are parametrised by its total mass M and a smoothing scale s that quantifies the characteristic scale over which M is distributed. For a range of these parameters, we are able to reproduce accurately the observations. This suggests that light is a good tracer of mass. Interestingly, this also shows that a localised strong lensing analysis (on scales of ~10"") allows us to constrain global properties of the group as a whole (on scales of ~100). Indeed, we constrain the group mass-to-light ratio to be M/L=98+-27 (i band, solar units, not corrected for evolution) and s=20"" +- 9 (2sigma confidence level). We demonstrate that these strong lensing only constraints are due to the perturbed strong lensing configuration, where the main arc is located at ~5"" from the galaxy, whereas its counter-image is found at ~8"". To test independently our resulting strong lensing model, we pursue an independent weak lensing analysis of the group and find a mass-to-light ratio in the range 66-146 (1sigma confidence level).

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,The Type Ia Supernova Rate in Redshift 0.5--0.9 Galaxy Clusters,1970,"  Supernova (SN) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichment and SN physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. We have carried out a survey for supernovae (SNe) in galaxy clusters, at a redshift range 0.5<z<0.9, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that were previously imaged by ACS, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, in which we discovered five likely cluster SNe, six possible cluster SNe Ia, two hostless SN candidates, and several background and foreground events. Keck spectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. We conducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellar luminosities of the clusters using Subaru images. We derive a cluster SN rate of 0.35 SNuB +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01 (systematic) [where SNuB = SNe (100 yr 10^10 L_B_sun)^-1] and 0.112 SNuM +0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic) [where SNuM = SNe (100 yr 10^10 M_sun)^-1]. As in previous measurements of cluster SN rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics. The SN rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the SN rate in clusters at lower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, at most, only a slight increase of cluster SN rate with increasing redshift. The low and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the iron mass in clusters was already in place by z~1. The recently observed doubling of iron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, is likely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new production of iron.

Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth provided by HST/ACS observations in three passbands, we identify 51 new multiply imaged galaxies, quadrupling the previous census and bringing the grand total to 68, comprising 194 individual lensed images. Having selected a subset of the 57 most securely identified multiply imaged galaxies, we use the Lenstool software package to constrain a lens model comprised of two cluster-scale dark-matter halos and 98 galaxy-scale halos. Our best-fit model predicts image positions with an $RMS$ error of 0.68'', which constitutes an improvement of almost a factor of two over previous, pre-HFF models of this cluster. We find the total projected mass inside a 200~kpc aperture to be $(1.60\pm0.01)\times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$, a measurement that offers a three-fold improvement in precision, reaching the percent level for the first time in any cluster. Finally, we quantify the increase in precision of the derived gravitational magnification of high-redshift galaxies and find an improvement by a factor of $\sim$2.5 in the statistical uncertainty. Our findings impressively confirm that HFF imaging has indeed opened the domain of high-precision mass measurements for massive clusters of galaxies.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,SPIDERS: the spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray selected clusters of   galaxies in SDSS-IV,1970,"  SPIDERS (The SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources) is a program dedicated to the homogeneous and complete spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray AGN and galaxy clusters over a large area ($\sim$7500 deg$^2$) of the extragalactic sky. SPIDERS is part of the SDSS-IV project, together with the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Time-Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS). This paper describes the largest project within SPIDERS before the launch of eROSITA: an optical spectroscopic survey of X-ray selected, massive ($\sim 10^{14}$ to $10^{15}~M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters discovered in ROSAT and XMM-Newton imaging. The immediate aim is to determine precise ($\Delta_z \sim 0.001$) redshifts for 4,000-5,000 of these systems out to $z \sim 0.6$. The scientific goal of the program is precision cosmology, using clusters as probes of large-scale structure in the expanding Universe. We present the cluster samples, target selection algorithms and observation strategies. We demonstrate the efficiency of selecting targets using a combination of SDSS imaging data, a robust red-sequence finder and a dedicated prioritization scheme. We describe a set of algorithms and work-flow developed to collate spectra and assign cluster membership, and to deliver catalogues of spectroscopically confirmed clusters.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Quasi-Stellar Objects acting as potential Strong Gravitational Lenses in   the SDSS-III BOSS survey,1970,"  We present a sample of 12 Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) potentially acting as strong gravitational lenses on background Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) or Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) selected selected through a systematic search of the 297301 QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Data Release 12. Candidates are identified by looking for compound spectra, where emission lines at a redshift larger than that of the quasar can be identified in the residuals after a QSO spectral template is subtracted from the observed spectra. The narrow diameter of BOSS fibers (2"") then ensures that the object responsible for the additional emission lines must lie close to the line of sight of the QSO and hence provides a high probability of lensing. Among the 12 candidates identified, 9 have definite evidence for the presence of a background ELG identified by at least 4 higher-redshift nebular emission lines. The remaining $3$ probable candidates present a strong asymmetrical emission line attributed to a background Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE). The QSO-ELG (QSO-LAE) lens candidates have QSO lens redshifts in the range $0.24\lesssim z_{QSO} \lesssim 0.66$ ($0.75 \lesssim z_{QSO} \lesssim 1.23$ ) and background galaxy redshifts in the range $0.48 \lesssim z_{S,ELG} \lesssim 0.94$ ($2.17 \lesssim z_{S,LAE} \lesssim 4.48$). We show that the algorithmic search is complete at >90% for QSO-ELG systems, whereas it falls at 40-60% for QSO-LAE, depending on the redshift of the source. Upon confirmation of the lensing nature of the systems, this sample may quadruple the number of known QSOs acting as strong lenses. We have determined the completeness of our search, which allows future studies to compute lensing probabilities of galaxies by QSOs and differentiate between different QSO models.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,High Performance Computing for gravitational lens modeling: single vs   double precision on GPUs and CPUs,1970,"  Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and the dark matter distribution. Efficient lensing software is already a necessity to fully use its potential and the performance demands will only increase with the upcoming generation of telescopes. In this paper, we study the possible impact of High Performance Computing techniques on a performance-critical part of the widely used lens modeling software LENSTOOL. We implement the algorithm once as a highly optimized CPU version and once with graphics card acceleration for a simple parametric lens model. In addition, we study the impact of finite machine precision on the lensing algorithm. While double precision is the default choice for scientific applications, we find that single precision can be sufficiently accurate for our purposes and lead to a big speedup. Therefore we develop and present a mixed precision algorithm which only uses double precision when necessary. We measure the performance of the different implementations and find that the use of High Performance Computing Techniques dramatically improves the code performance both on CPUs and GPUs. Compared to the current LENSTOOL implementation on 12 CPU cores, we obtain speedup factors of up to 170. We achieve this optimal performance by using our mixed precision algorithm on a high-end GPU which is common in modern supercomputers. We also show that these techniques reduce the energy consumption by up to 98%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a highly competitive speedup can be reached with consumer GPUs. While they are an order of magnitude cheaper than the high-end graphics cards, they are rarely used for scientific computations due to their low double precision performance. Our mixed precision algorithm unlocks their full potential. The consumer GPU delivers a speedup which is only a factor of four lower than the best speedup achieved by a high-end GPU.

We apply SHAM on the UNIT simulation to simulate SDSS BOSS/eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) within a wide redshift range of $0.2 < z < 1.0$. Besides the typical SHAM scatter parameter $\sigma$, we include $v_{\rm smear}$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ to take into account the redshift uncertainty and the galaxy incompleteness respectively. These two additional parameters are critical for reproducing the observed 2PCF multipoles on 5--25$\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. The redshift uncertainties obtained from the best-fitting $v_{\rm smear}$ agree with those measured from repeat observations for all SDSS LRGs except for the LOWZ sample. We explore several potential systematics but none of them can explain the discrepancy found in LOWZ. Our explanation is that the LOWZ galaxies might contain another type of galaxies which needs to be treated differently. The evolution of the measured $\sigma$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ also reveals that the incompleteness of eBOSS galaxies decreases with the redshift. This is the consequence of the magnitude lower limit applied in eBOSS LRG target selection. Our SHAM also set upper limits for the intrinsic scatter of the galaxy--halo relation given a complete galaxy sample: $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.31$ for LOWZ at $0.2<z<0.33$, $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.36$ for LOWZ at $0.33<z<0.43$, and $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.46$ for CMASS at $0.43<z<0.51$.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,An unbiased method of measuring the ratio of two data sets,1970,"  In certain cases of astronomical data analysis, the meaningful physical quantity to extract is the ratio $R$ between two data sets. Examples include the lensing ratio, the interloper rate in spectroscopic redshift samples, the decay rate of gravitational potential and $E_G$ to test gravity. However, simply taking the ratio of the two data sets is biased, since it renders (even statistical) errors in the denominator into systematic errors in $R$. Furthermore, it is not optimal in minimizing statistical errors of $R$. Based on Bayesian analysis and the usual assumption of Gaussian error in the data, we derive an analytical expression of the posterior PDF $P(R)$. This result enables fast and unbiased $R$ measurement, with minimal statistical errors. Furthermore, it relies on no underlying model other than the proportionality relation between the two data sets. Even more generally, it applies to the cases where the proportionality relation holds for the underlying physics/statistics instead of the two data sets directly. It also applies to the case of multiple ratios ($R\rightarrow {\bf R}=(R_1,R_2,\cdots)$). We take the lensing ratio as an example to demonstrate our method. We take lenses as DESI imaging survey galaxies, and sources as DECaLS cosmic shear and \emph{Planck} CMB lensing. We restrict the analysis to the ratio between CMB lensing and cosmic shear. The resulting $P(R)$, for multiple lens-shear pairs, are all nearly Gaussian. The S/N of measured $R$ ranges from $4.9$ to $8.4$. We perform several tests to verify the robustness of the above result. ",https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/acda2a,2210.13717v2,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Cosmic void exclusion models and their impact on the distance scale   measurements from large scale structure,1970,"  Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) studies based on the clustering of voids and matter tracers provide important constraints on cosmological parameters related to the expansion of the Universe. However, modelling the void exclusion effect is an important challenge for fully exploiting the potential of this kind of analyses. We thus develop two numerical methods to describe the clustering of cosmic voids. Neither model requires additional cosmological information beyond that assumed within the galaxy de-wiggled model. The models consist in power spectra whose performance we assess in comparison to a parabolic model on Patchy cubic and light-cone mocks. Moreover, we test their robustness against systematic effects and the reconstruction technique. The void model power spectra and the parabolic model with a fixed parameter provide strongly correlated values for the Alcock-Paczynski ($\alpha$) parameter, for boxes and light-cones likewise. The resulting $\alpha$ values -- for all three models -- are unbiased and their uncertainties are correctly estimated. However, the numerical models show less variation with the fitting range compared to the parabolic one. The Bayesian evidence suggests that the numerical techniques are often favoured compared to the parabolic model. Moreover, the void model power spectra computed on boxes can describe the void clustering from light-cones as well as from boxes. The same void model power spectra can be used for the study of pre- and post-reconstructed data-sets. Lastly, the two numerical techniques are resilient against the studied systematic effects.

We explore this potential by combining the DESI 1\% survey and DECaLS DR8. With $\sim 106$ deg$^2$ sky overlap, we achieve significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing for BGS and LRG as lenses. Scaled to the full BGS sample, we expect the statistical errors to improve from $18(12)\%$ to a promising level of $2(1.3)\%$ at $\theta>8^{'}(<8^{'})$. This brings stronger requirements for future systematics control. To fully realize such potential, we need to control the residual multiplicative shear bias $|m|<0.01$ and the bias in the mean redshift $|\Delta z|<0.015$. We also expect significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing with DESI LRG/ELG full samples as lenses, and cosmic magnification of ELG through cross-correlation with low-redshift DECaLS shear. {If such systematical error control can be achieved,} we find the advantages of DECaLS, comparing with KiDS (Kilo Degree Survey) and HSC (Hyper-Suprime Cam), are at low redshift, large-scale, and in measuring the shear-ratio (to $\sigma_R\sim 0.04$) and cosmic magnification.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,CURLING - I. The Influence of Point-like Image Approximation on the   Outcomes of Cluster Strong Lens Modeling,1970,"  Cluster-scale strong lensing is a powerful tool for exploring the properties of dark matter and constraining cosmological models. However, due to the complex parameter space, pixelized strong lens modeling in galaxy clusters is computationally expensive, leading to the point-source approximation of strongly lensed extended images, potentially introducing systematic biases. Herein, as the first paper of the ClUsteR strong Lens modelIng for the Next-Generation observations (CURLING) program, we use lensing ray-tracing simulations to quantify the biases and uncertainties arising from the point-like image approximation for JWST-like observations. Our results indicate that the approximation works well for reconstructing the total cluster mass distribution, but can bias the magnification measurements near critical curves and the constraints on the cosmological parameters, the total matter density of the Universe $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. To mitigate the biases, we propose incorporating the extended surface brightness distribution of lensed sources into the modeling. This approach reduces the bias in magnification from 46.2 per cent to 0.09 per cent for $\mu \sim 1000$. Furthermore, the median values of cosmological parameters align more closely with the fiducial model. In addition to the improved accuracy, we also demonstrate that the constraining power can be substantially enhanced. In conclusion, it is necessary to model cluster-scale strong lenses with pixelized multiple images, especially for estimating the intrinsic luminosity of highly magnified sources and accurate cosmography in the era of high-precision observations.

0000-0002-4616-4989,Jean-Paul Kneib,EPFL,Strong gravitational lensing probes of the particle nature of dark   matter,1970,"  There is a vast menagerie of plausible candidates for the constituents of dark matter, both within and beyond extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Each of these candidates may have scattering (and other) cross section properties that are consistent with the dark matter abundance, BBN, and the most scales in the matter power spectrum; but which may have vastly different behavior at sub-galactic ""cutoff"" scales, below which dark matter density fluctuations are smoothed out. The only way to quantitatively measure the power spectrum behavior at sub-galactic scales at distances beyond the local universe, and indeed over cosmic time, is through probes available in multiply imaged strong gravitational lenses. Gravitational potential perturbations by dark matter substructure encode information in the observed relative magnifications, positions, and time delays in a strong lens. Each of these is sensitive to a different moment of the substructure mass function and to different effective mass ranges of the substructure. The time delay perturbations, in particular, are proving to be largely immune to the degeneracies and systematic uncertainties that have impacted exploitation of strong lenses for such studies. There is great potential for a coordinated theoretical and observational effort to enable a sophisticated exploitation of strong gravitational lenses as direct probes of dark matter properties. This opportunity motivates this white paper, and drives the need for: a) strong support of the theoretical work necessary to understand all astrophysical consequences for different dark matter candidates; and b) tailored observational campaigns, and even a fully dedicated mission, to obtain the requisite data.

0000-0002-8947-1954,Shuo Liu,EPFL,Inductive Cognitive Diagnosis for Fast Student Learning in Web-Based   Online Intelligent Education Systems,1970,"  Cognitive diagnosis aims to gauge students' mastery levels based on their response logs. Serving as a pivotal module in web-based online intelligent education systems (WOIESs), it plays an upstream and fundamental role in downstream tasks like learning item recommendation and computerized adaptive testing. WOIESs are open learning environment where numerous new students constantly register and complete exercises. In WOIESs, efficient cognitive diagnosis is crucial to fast feedback and accelerating student learning. However, the existing cognitive diagnosis methods always employ intrinsically transductive student-specific embeddings, which become slow and costly due to retraining when dealing with new students who are unseen during training. To this end, this paper proposes an inductive cognitive diagnosis model (ICDM) for fast new students' mastery levels inference in WOIESs. Specifically, in ICDM, we propose a novel student-centered graph (SCG). Rather than inferring mastery levels through updating student-specific embedding, we derive the inductive mastery levels as the aggregated outcomes of students' neighbors in SCG. Namely, SCG enables to shift the task from finding the most suitable student-specific embedding that fits the response logs to finding the most suitable representations for different node types in SCG, and the latter is more efficient since it no longer requires retraining. To obtain this representation, ICDM consists of a construction-aggregation-generation-transformation process to learn the final representation of students, exercises and concepts. Extensive experiments across real-world datasets show that, compared with the existing cognitive diagnosis methods that are always transductive, ICDM is much more faster while maintains the competitive inference performance for new students.

With a strong coupling light, we observe the Autler-Townes doublet and investigate experimentally the dependence of the separation and linewidth on the coupling intensity, which is consistent with the prediction based on the dressed state theory. We further investigate the Rydberg spectra with an external magnetic field. The existence of non-degenerate Zeeman sub-levels results in the broadening and shift of the spectra.

0000-0002-8947-1954,Shuo Liu,EPFL,Towards implementation of a magic optical-dipole trap for confining   ground-state and Rydberg-state cesium cold atoms,1970,"  Long ground-Rydberg coherence lifetime is interesting for implementing high-fidelity quantum logic gates, many-body physics, and other quantum information protocols. However, the potential formed by a conventional far-off-resonance red-detuned optical-dipole trap (ODT) is usually repulsive for Rydberg atoms, which will result in fast atom loss and low repetition rate of the experimental sequence. These issues can be addressed by a magic ODT. We performed the calculation of ODT's magic detuning for confinement of cesium ground state and Rydberg state with the same potential well. We used a sum-over-states method to calculate the dynamic polarizabilities of $6S_{1/2}$ ground state and highly-excited ($nS_{1/2}$ and $nP_{3/2}$) Rydberg state of cesium atoms, and identify corresponding magic detuning for optical wavelengths in the range of $850 - 2000$ nm. We estimated the trapping lifetime of cesium Rydberg atoms confined in the magic ODT by including different dissipative mechanisms. Furthermore, we have experimentally realized an 1879.43-nm single-frequency laser system with a watt-level output power for setting up the magic ODT for $6S_{1/2}$ ground-state and $84P_{3/2}$ Rydberg-state cesium cold atoms.

0000-0002-8947-1954,Shuo Liu,EPFL,Training variational quantum algorithms with random gate activation,1970,"  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold great potentials for near-term applications and are promising to achieve quantum advantage on practical tasks. However, VQAs suffer from severe barren plateau problem as well as have a large probability of being trapped in local minima. In this Letter, we propose a novel training algorithm with random quantum gate activation for VQAs to efficiently address these two issues. This new algorithm processes effectively much fewer training parameters than the conventional plain optimization strategy, which efficiently mitigates barren plateaus with the same expressive capability. Additionally, by randomly adding two-qubit gates to the circuit ansatz, the optimization trajectories can escape from local minima and reach the global minimum more frequently due to more sources of randomness. In real quantum experiments, the new training algorithm can also reduce the quantum computational resources required and be more quantum noise resilient. We apply our training algorithm to solve variational quantum simulation problems for ground states and present convincing results that showcase the advantages of our novel strategy where better performance is achieved by the combination of mitigating barren plateaus, escaping from local minima, and reducing the effect of quantum noises. We further propose that the entanglement phase transition could be one underlying reason why our RA training is so effective.

We propose a novel, multistage fusion method where the two information streams are integrated in several layers of a deep neural network (DNN), and contrast it with a single-stage one where the streams are merged in a single point. Both methods depend on extracting summary linguistic embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model, and conditioning one or more intermediate representations of a convolutional model operating on log-Mel spectrograms. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the two fusion methods clearly outperform a shallow (late) fusion baseline and their unimodal constituents, both in terms of quantitative performance and qualitative behaviour.

Permissioned blockchains are particularly enlightened by companies, enterprises, and government agencies due to their efficiency, customizability, and governance-friendly features. Obviously, seamlessly fusing blockchain and cloud computing can significantly benefit permissioned blockchains; nevertheless, most blockchains implemented on clouds are originally designed for loosely-coupled networks where nodes communicate asynchronously, failing to take advantages of the closely-coupled nature of cloud servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative cloud-oriented blockchain -- CloudChain, which is a modularized three-layer system composed of the network layer, consensus layer, and blockchain layer. CloudChain is based on a shared-memory model where nodes communicate synchronously by direct memory accesses. We realize the shared-memory model with the Remote Direct Memory Access technology, based on which we propose a shared-memory consensus algorithm to ensure presistence and liveness, the two crucial blockchain security properties countering Byzantine nodes.

Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building a LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of $8$ representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates $6$ categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and embodied artificial intelligence on $47$ standard text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study reveals several innovative findings. First, instruction-tuned LVLM with massive in-domain data such as InstructBLIP heavily overfits many existing tasks, generalizing poorly in the open-world scenario. Second, instruction-tuned LVLM with moderate instruction-following data may result in object hallucination issues (i.e., generate objects that are inconsistent with target images in the descriptions). It either makes the current evaluation metric such as CIDEr for image captioning ineffective or generates wrong answers. Third, employing a multi-turn reasoning evaluation framework can mitigate the issue of object hallucination, shedding light on developing an effective pipeline for LVLM evaluation.

Leveraging the capability hierarchy, ConvBench enables precise attribution of conversation mistakes to specific levels. Experimental results reveal a performance gap between multi-modal models, including GPT4-V, and human performance in multi-turn conversations. Additionally, weak fine-grained perception in multi-modal models contributes to reasoning and creation failures.

The implicit and varied forms of expression in internet language complicate accurate and rapid identification of suicidal intent on social media, thus creating challenges for timely intervention efforts. The development of deep learning models for suicide risk detection is a promising solution, but there is a notable lack of relevant datasets, especially in the Chinese context. To address this gap, this study presents a Chinese social media dataset designed for fine-grained suicide risk classification, focusing on indicators such as expressions of suicide intent, methods of suicide, and urgency of timing. Seven pre-trained models were evaluated in two tasks: high and low suicide risk, and fine-grained suicide risk classification on a level of 0 to 10. In our experiments, deep learning models show good performance in distinguishing between high and low suicide risk, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 88.39%. However, the results for fine-grained suicide risk classification were still unsatisfactory, with an weighted F1 score of 50.89%. To address the issues of data imbalance and limited dataset size, we investigated both traditional and advanced, large language model based data augmentation techniques, demonstrating that data augmentation can enhance model performance by up to 4.65% points in F1-score. Notably, the Chinese MentalBERT model, which was pre-trained on psychological domain data, shows superior performance in both tasks. This study provides valuable insights for automatic identification of suicidal individuals, facilitating timely psychological intervention on social media platforms.

0000-0002-8947-1954,Shuo Liu,EPFL,Exploring and Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models in Automated   Code Translation,1970,"  Code translation tools (transpilers) are developed for automatic source-to-source translation. Although learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora. Their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive. LLMs pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific training. Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet. This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs, missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation, and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs. Enlightened by the above findings, we further propose UniTrans, a Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field. Specifically, UniTrans first crafts a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs. Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution. Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. Extensive experiments are conducted on six settings of translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++. Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2404.14646v2,Yes,potent(1)

The SOS-HL-1K dataset contained 1,249 posts and SocialCD-3K dataset was a multi-label classification dataset that containing 3,407 posts. We propose a comprehensive evaluation using two supervised learning methods and eight large language models (LLMs) on the proposed datasets. From the prompt engineering perspective, we experimented with two types of prompt strategies, including four zero-shot and five few-shot strategies. We also evaluated the performance of the LLMs after fine-tuning on the proposed tasks. The experimental results show that there is still a huge gap between LLMs relying only on prompt engineering and supervised learning. In the suicide classification task, this gap is 6.95% points in F1-score, while in the cognitive distortion task, the gap is even more pronounced, reaching 31.53% points in F1-score. However, after fine-tuning, this difference is significantly reduced. In the suicide and cognitive distortion classification tasks, the gap decreases to 4.31% and 3.14%, respectively. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in psychological contexts, but supervised learning remains necessary for more challenging tasks. All datasets and code are made available.

0000-0002-8947-1954,Shuo Liu,EPFL,Polarization-controlled anisotropic coding metamaterials at terahertz   frequencies,1970,"  Metamaterials based on effective media have achieved a lot of unusual physics (e.g. negative refraction and invisibility cloaking) owing to their abilities to tailor the effective medium parameters that do not exist in nature. Recently, coding metamaterials have been suggested to control electromagnetic waves by designing the coding sequences of digital elements '0' and '1', which possess opposite phase responses. Here, we propose the concept of anisotropic coding metamaterial at terahertz frequencies, in which coding behaviors in different directions are dependent on the polarization status of terahertz waves. We experimentally demonstrate an ultrathin and flexible polarization-controlled anisotropic coding metasurface functioning in the terahertz regime using specially- designed coding elements. By encoding the elements with elaborately-designed digital sequences (in both 1 bit and 2 bits), the x- and y-polarized reflected waves can be deflected or diffused independently in three dimensions. The simulated far-field scattering patterns as well as near-electric-field distributions are given to illustrate the bifunctional performance of the encoded metasurface, which show good agreement to the measurement results. We further demonstrate the abilities of anisotropic coding metasurface to generate beam splitter and realize anomalous reflection and polarization conversion simultaneously, providing powerful controls of differently-polarized terahertz waves. The proposed method enables versatile beam behaviors under orthogonal polarizations using a single metasurface, and hence will promise interesting terahertz devices.

This has led to a wave of applications that utilise AI technologies; first and foremost in the fields of medical imaging, but also in the use of wearables and other intelligent sensors.

Yet, audition has long been a staple assistant for medical practitioners, with the stethoscope being the quintessential sign of doctors around the world. Transforming this traditional technology with the use of AI entails a set of unique challenges. We categorise the advances needed in four key pillars: Hear, corresponding to the cornerstone technologies needed to analyse auditory signals in real-life conditions; Earlier, for the advances needed in computational and data efficiency; Attentively, for accounting to individual differences and handling the longitudinal nature of medical data; and, finally, Responsibly, for ensuring compliance to the ethical standards accorded to the field of medicine.

However, existing multimodal evaluation benchmarks cover a limited number of multimodal tasks testing rudimentary capabilities, falling short in tracking LVLM development.

0000-0001-8069-2411,Nathan Ronceray,EPFL,Modeling the shape of axisymmetric skyrmions in magnetic multilayers,1970,"  We present a comprehensive micromagnetic model of isolated axisymmetric skyrmions in magnetic multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy. Most notably, the essential role of the internal dipolar field is extensively considered with a minimum amount of assumptions on the magnetization profiles. The tri-dimensional structure of the multilayered skyrmions is modeled by their radial profiles in each layer. We first compare the results of the model against a full micromagnetic description in Cartesian coordinates. Our model combines information on both layer-dependent size and chirality of the skyrmions. We also provide a convenient criterion in order to characterize the stability of skyrmions against anisotropic elongations that would break their cylindrical symmetry, which allows to confirm the stability of the determined solutions. Because this model is able to treat magnetization configurations twisted through the thickness of multilayered skyrmions, it can provide predictions on any potential hybrid chirality in skyrmions due to the interplay of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and dipolar interactions in multilayers. We finally apply the results of our model to the description of the current-driven dynamics of hybrid chiral skyrmions. Using the Thiele formalism, we show that we can predict the forces exerted on the multilayered skyrmions by vertical spin-polarized currents, which provides a method to conform hybrid skyrmion chiralities and spin-current injection geometries in order to optimize skyrmion motion in multilayers, to the aim of maximizing the current-induced velocity, or canceling the skyrmion Hall angle.

While advancements in spatial resolution have been made through scanning probe methods, monitoring dynamics over large areas is still challenging, and it would be beneficial to be able to decouple the probe from the electrode itself. In this work, we leverage single molecule microscopy to spatiotemporally monitor analyte surface concentrations over a wide area using unmodified hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in organic solvents. Through a sensing scheme based on redox-active species interactions with fluorescent emitters at the surface of hBN, we observe a linear decrease in the number of emitters under positive voltages applied to a nearby electrode. We find consistent trends in electrode reaction kinetics vs overpotentials between potentiostat-reported currents and optically-read emitter dynamics, showing Tafel slopes greater than 290 mV per decade. Finally, we draw on the capabilities of spectral single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to monitor the fluorescent species identity, enabling multiplexed readout. Overall, we show dynamic measurements of analyte concentration gradients at a micrometer-length scale with nanometer-scale depth and precision. Considering the many scalable options for engineering fluorescent emitters with 2D materials, our method holds promise for optically detecting a range of interacting species with unprecedented localization precision.

We show that the 4n^2 limit can be potentially exceeded in a wide angular and wavelength range using two-dimensional periodic thin film structures. Two models are used to estimate the absorption enhancement; in the first one, we apply the periodicity condition along the thickness of the thin film structure but in the second one, we consider imperfect confinement of the wave to the device. To extract the guided modes, we use an automatized procedure which is established in this work. Through examples, we show that from the optical point of view, thin film structures have a high potential to be improved by changing their shape. Also, we discuss the nature of different optical resonances which can be potentially used to enhance light trapping in the solar cell. We investigate the two different polarization directions for one-dimensional gratings and we show that the transverse magnetic polarization can provide higher values of absorption enhancement. We also propose a way to reduce the angular dependence of the solar cell efficiency by the appropriate choice of periodic pattern. Finally, to get more practical values for the absorption enhancement, we consider the effect of parasitic loss which can significantly reduce the enhancement factor.

However, they often suffer from communication bottlenecks. Confronting this issue, a communication-efficient primal-dual coordinate ascent framework (CoCoA) and its improved variant CoCoA+ have been proposed, achieving a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ for solving empirical risk minimization problems with Lipschitz continuous losses. In this paper, an accelerated variant of CoCoA+ is proposed and shown to possess a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/t^2)$ in terms of reducing suboptimality. The analysis of this rate is also notable in that the convergence rate bounds involve constants that, except in extreme cases, are significantly reduced compared to those previously provided for CoCoA+. The results of numerical experiments are provided to show that acceleration can lead to significant performance gains. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1711.05305v1,Yes,notable(1)

Yet, conventional assumptions, such as smoothness, do often not enable us to make finely-grained convergence statements -- particularly not for non-convex problems. Striving for a more intricate characterization of complexity, we introduce a unique concept termed graded non-convexity. This allows to partition the class of non-convex problems into a nested chain of subclasses. Interestingly, many traditional non-convex objectives, including partially convex problems, matrix factorizations, and neural networks, fall within these subclasses. As a second contribution, we propose gradient methods with spectral preconditioning, which employ inexact top eigenvectors of the Hessian to address the ill-conditioning of the problem, contingent on the grade. Our analysis reveals that these new methods provide provably superior convergence rates compared to basic gradient descent on applicable problem classes, particularly when large gaps exist between the top eigenvalues of the Hessian. Our theory is validated by numerical experiments executed on multiple practical machine learning problems. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2402.04843v1,Yes,intricate(1)

Even though the size of these models limits their application in compute-constrained environments, the race to continually develop ever larger and deeper foundational models is underway. At the same time -- regardless of the model size -- task-specific techniques continue to play a pivotal role in achieving optimal downstream performance. One of these techniques, called Chain-of-Thought (CoT), is particularly interesting since, as we point out in this work, it resembles employing a deeper transformer through re-applying the model multiple times. However, a key subtlety in computing the attention of past tokens differentiates CoT from simply applying the model several times. Based on this insight, we propose CoTFormer, a novel architecture which closely mimics CoT at the token level, allowing us to obtain significantly improved accuracies close to much larger models. While applying CoT introduces additional computation costs, we compensate for it by leveraging CoTFormer's special compatibility with token-wise variable depth. Through a compute adaptive model -- which automatically allocates the compute to tokens that need it most -- we show that it is possible to reduce the computation cost significantly without any reduction in accuracy, and with further compute cost reductions possible while maintaining a competitive accuracy.

MoDN is a novel decision tree composed of feature-specific neural network modules.

While first-order methods seem to dominate the field, second-order methods are nevertheless attractive as they potentially require fewer communication rounds to converge. However, there are significant drawbacks that impede their wide adoption, such as the computation and the communication of a large Hessian matrix. In this paper we present a new algorithm for distributed training of generalized linear models that only requires the computation of diagonal blocks of the Hessian matrix on the individual workers. To deal with this approximate information we propose an adaptive approach that - akin to trust-region methods - dynamically adapts the auxiliary model to compensate for modeling errors. We provide theoretical rates of convergence for a wide class of problems including L1-regularized objectives.

We provide convergence guarantees for two algorithms in this setting -- a popular collaboration method known as weighted gradient averaging, and a novel bias correction method -- and explore conditions under which we can achieve linear speedup w.r.t. the number of auxiliary tasks N.

0000-0003-1579-5558,Martin Jaggi,EPFL,"MultiModN- Multimodal, Multi-Task, Interpretable Modular Networks",1970,"  Predicting multiple real-world tasks in a single model often requires a particularly diverse feature space. Multimodal (MM) models aim to extract the synergistic predictive potential of multiple data types to create a shared feature space with aligned semantic meaning across inputs of drastically varying sizes (i.e. images, text, sound). Most current MM architectures fuse these representations in parallel, which not only limits their interpretability but also creates a dependency on modality availability. We present MultiModN, a multimodal, modular network that fuses latent representations in a sequence of any number, combination, or type of modality while providing granular real-time predictive feedback on any number or combination of predictive tasks. MultiModN's composable pipeline is interpretable-by-design, as well as innately multi-task and robust to the fundamental issue of biased missingness. We perform four experiments on several benchmark MM datasets across 10 real-world tasks (predicting medical diagnoses, academic performance, and weather), and show that MultiModN's sequential MM fusion does not compromise performance compared with a baseline of parallel fusion. By simulating the challenging bias of missing not-at-random (MNAR), this work shows that, contrary to MultiModN, parallel fusion baselines erroneously learn MNAR and suffer catastrophic failure when faced with different patterns of MNAR at inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first inherently MNAR-resistant approach to MM modeling. In conclusion, MultiModN provides granular insights, robustness, and flexibility without compromising performance. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2309.14118v2,Yes,potent(1)

While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2.

AoI may provide insights into quality of service in communication systems. For this reason, it has been used as a cross-layer metric for wireless communication protocols. In this work, we employ AoI to calculate penalty functions for a centralized resource scheduling problem. We consider a single wireless link shared by multiple, heterogeneous control systems where each sub-system has a time-varying packet loss probability. Sub-systems are competing for network resources to improve the accuracy of their remote estimation process. In order to cope with the dynamically changing conditions of the wireless link, we define a finite horizon age-penalty minimization problem and propose a scheduler that takes optimal decisions by looking $H$ slots into the future. The proposed algorithm has a worst-case complexity that grows exponentially with $H$. However, by narrowing down our search space within the constrained set of actions, we are able to decrease the complexity significantly without losing optimality. On the contrary, we show by simulations that the benefit of increasing $H$ w.r.t. remote state estimation performance diminishes after a certain $H$ value.

Emerging applications, such as telerobotics, drones and autonomous driving are the most prominent examples of such systems. Regular and timely information sharing between the components of NCSs is essential to fulfill the desired control tasks, as stale information can lead to performance degradation or even physical damage. In this work, we consider multiple heterogeneous NCSs that transmit their system state over a shared physical wireless channel towards a gateway node. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study on selected MAC protocols using software-defined radios with state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions that have been designed to increase information freshness and control performance. As a significant improvement over the SotA, we propose a novel contention-free algorithm that is able to outperform the existing solutions by combining their strengths in one protocol. In addition, we propose a new metric called normalized mean squared error that maps the age of information to a dimensionless quantity that captures the expected value of a control system's next transmission. We demonstrate its adoption and effectiveness for wireless resource scheduling in a case study involving multiple inverted pendulums. From our experimental study and results, we observe that value-aware prioritization of the sub-systems contributes to minimizing the negative effects of information staleness on control performance. In particular, as the number of devices increases, the benefit of control-awareness to the quality of control stands out when compared to protocols that focus solely on maximizing information freshness.

In the context of networked control systems (NCSs), we compare the worth of the AoI metric with the value-of-information (VoI) metric, which is related to the uncertainty reduction in stochastic processes. First, we show that the uncertainty propagates non-linearly over time depending on system dynamics. Next, we define the value of a new update of the process of interest as a function of AoI and system parameters of the NCSs. We use the aggregated update value as a utility for the centralized scheduling problem in a cellular NCS composed of multiple heterogeneous control loops.

0000-0001-9013-435X,Martin Schulz,Technical University of Munich,Design Principles of Dynamic Resource Management for High-Performance   Parallel Programming Models,1970,"  With Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) the resources assigned to a job can be changed dynamically during its execution. From the system's perspective, DRM opens a new level of flexibility in resource allocation and job scheduling and therefore has the potential to improve system efficiency metrics such as the utilization rate, job throughput, energy efficiency, and responsiveness. From the application perspective, users can tailor the resources they request to their needs offering potential optimizations in queuing time or charged costs. Despite these obvious advantages and many attempts over the last decade to establish DRM in HPC, it remains a concept discussed in academia rather than being successfully deployed on production systems. This stems from the fact that support for DRM requires changes in all the layers of the HPC system software stack including applications, programming models, process managers, and resource management software, as well as an extensive and holistic co-design process to establish new techniques and policies for scheduling and resource optimization. In this work, we therefore start with the assumption that resources are accessible by processes executed either on them (e.g., on CPU) or controlling them (e.g., GPU-offloading). Then, the overall DRM problem can be decomposed into dynamic process management (DPM) and dynamic resource mapping or allocation (DRA). The former determines which processes (or which change in processes) must be managed and the latter identifies the resources where they will be executed. The interfaces for such \mbox{DPM/DPA} in these layers need to be standardized, which requires a careful design to be interoperable while providing high flexibility. Based on a survey of existing approaches we propose design principles, that form the basis of a holistic approach to DMR in HPC and provide a prototype implementation using MPI.

Given the power consumption trends, future systems will be deployed in an over-provisioned manner where more resources are installed than they can afford to power simultaneously. In such a scenario, maximizing resource utilization and energy efficiency, while keeping a given power constraint, is pivotal. Driven by this observation, in this position paper we first highlight the recent trends of resource management techniques, with a particular focus on malleability support (i.e., dynamically scaling resource allocations/requirements for a job), co-scheduling (i.e., co-locating multiple jobs within a node), and power management. Second, we consider putting them together, assess their relationships/synergies, and discuss the functionality requirements in each software component for future over-provisioned and power-constrained HPC systems. Third, we briefly introduce our ongoing efforts on the integration of software tools, which will ultimately lead to the convergence of malleability and power management, as it is designed in the HPC PowerStack initiative.

With these domains typically being power-constrained and event-based while requiring low latency, neuromorphic algorithms in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential. Yet, current effective SNN solutions require a contextual sampling window imposing substantial latency, typically around 32ms, too long for many applications. Inspired by Dual-Path Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNNs) in classical neural networks, we develop a two-phase time-domain streaming SNN framework -- the Dual-Path Spiking Neural Network (DPSNN). In the DPSNN, the first phase uses Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) to capture global contextual information, while the second phase uses Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs) to focus on frequency-related features. In addition, the regularizer suppresses activation to further enhance energy efficiency of our DPSNNs. Evaluating on the VCTK and Intel DNS Datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the very low latency (approximately 5ms) required for applications like hearing aids, while demonstrating excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual quality, and energy efficiency.

This paper considers the BCD method that successively updates a series of blocks selected according to a Markov chain. This kind of block selection is neither i.i.d. random nor cyclic. On the other hand, it is a natural choice for some applications in distributed optimization and Markov decision process, where i.i.d. random and cyclic selections are either infeasible or very expensive. By applying mixing-time properties of a Markov chain, we prove convergence of Markov chain BCD for minimizing Lipschitz differentiable functions, which can be nonconvex. When the functions are convex and strongly convex, we establish both sublinear and linear convergence rates, respectively. We also present a method of Markov chain inertial BCD.

0009-0004-6858-4791,Tao Sun,Technical University of Munich,Asynchronous Coordinate Descent under More Realistic Assumptions,1970,"  Asynchronous-parallel algorithms have the potential to vastly speed up algorithms by eliminating costly synchronization. However, our understanding to these algorithms is limited because the current convergence of asynchronous (block) coordinate descent algorithms are based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the age of the shared optimization variables being used to update a block is assumed to be independent of the block being updated. Also, it is assumed that the updates are applied to randomly chosen blocks. In this paper, we argue that these assumptions either fail to hold or will imply less efficient implementations. We then prove the convergence of asynchronous-parallel block coordinate descent under more realistic assumptions, in particular, always without the independence assumption. The analysis permits both the deterministic (essentially) cyclic and random rules for block choices. Because a bound on the asynchronous delays may or may not be available, we establish convergence for both bounded delays and unbounded delays. The analysis also covers nonconvex, weakly convex, and strongly convex functions. We construct Lyapunov functions that directly model both objective progress and delays, so delays are not treated errors or noise. A continuous-time ODE is provided to explain the construction at a high level. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1705.08494v2,Yes,potent(1)

However, the externally trained DNNs can potentially be backdoor attacked. It is crucial to defend against such attacks, i.e., to postprocess a suspicious model so that its backdoor behavior is mitigated while its normal prediction power on clean inputs remain uncompromised. To remove the abnormal backdoor behavior, existing methods mostly rely on additional labeled clean samples. However, such requirement may be unrealistic as the training data are often unavailable to end users. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of circumventing such barrier. We propose a novel defense method that does not require training labels. Through a carefully designed layer-wise weight re-initialization and knowledge distillation, our method can effectively cleanse backdoor behaviors of a suspicious network with negligible compromise in its normal behavior. In experiments, we show that our method, trained without labels, is on-par with state-of-the-art defense methods trained using labels. We also observe promising defense results even on out-of-distribution data. This makes our method very practical. Code is available at: https://github.com/luluppang/BCU.

By taking advantage of the extractable part-whole dependencies available in capsule layers, we derive the probabilities of the class labels for individual capsules through a recursive, layer-by-layer procedure. We model this procedure as a traceback pipeline and take it as a central piece to build an end-to-end segmentation network. Under the proposed framework, image-level class labels and object boundaries are jointly sought in an explicit manner, which poses a significant advantage over the state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) solutions. With the capability to extracted part-whole information, our traceback pipeline can potentially be utilized as the building blocks to design interpretable neural networks.

The undergrounding of the power system is one approach to building such resiliency. In this study, we introduce Grid Underground Distribution Statistics (GUDS) for the US, the first nationwide comprehensive assessment of underground electricity distribution at a high spatial granularity. In analyzing this dataset, we find regional differences in underground distribution rates, with generally higher rates for east and west coasts and in northern states, and lower rates in the central US. We also observe relationships between underground rates and factors such as household income levels, degree of urbanization, and vulnerability to natural hazards. Notably, regions with higher electricity rates are not associated with greater proportions of underground distribution, highlighting potential equity issues in infrastructure distribution. By presenting this granular information and insights on underground distribution, our study offers valuable guidance for informing planning and decision-making by policymakers, Independent System Operators, utilities, and end-users.

This connection with elliptic curves is signalled by the presence of linear dependencies among the SIC vectors. Here we look for analogous connections between SICs and algebraic geometry by performing computer searches for linear dependencies in higher dimensional SICs. We prove that linear dependencies will always emerge in Weyl-Heisenberg orbits when the fiducial vector lies in a certain subspace of an order 3 unitary matrix. This includes SICs when the dimension is divisible by 3 or equal to 8 mod 9. We examine the linear dependencies in dimension 6 in detail and show that smaller dimensional SICs are contained within this structure, potentially impacting the SIC existence problem. We extend our results to look for linear dependencies in orbits when the fiducial vector lies in an eigenspace of other elements of the Clifford group that are not order 3.

It is, however, hard to infer these effects from observational data. One major problem that can arise is covariate shift where the data (outcome) conditional distribution remains the same but the covariate (input) distribution changes between the training and test set. In an observational data setting, this problem is materialised in control and treated units coming from different distributions. A common solution is to augment learning methods through reweighing schemes (e.g. propensity scores). These are needed due to model misspecification, but might hurt performance in the individual case. In this paper, we explore a novel generative tree based approach that tackles model misspecification directly, helping downstream estimators achieve better robustness. We show empirically that the choice of model class can indeed significantly affect the final performance and that reweighing methods can struggle in individualised effect estimation. Our proposed approach is competitive with reweighing methods on average treatment effects while performing significantly better on individualised treatment effects.

For example, we consider a study that investigates the benefit of interventions in young adulthood for ameliorating the poorer mid-life psychosocial outcomes of adolescent self-harmers relative to their healthy peers. Two methodological challenges arise. Firstly, mediation methods have hitherto mostly focused on the elusive task of discovering pathways, rather than on the evaluation of mediator interventions. Secondly, the complexity of such questions is invariably such that there are no existing data on well-defined interventions (i.e. actual treatments, programs, etc.) capturing the populations, outcomes and time-spans of interest. Instead, researchers must rely on exposure (non-intervention) data to address these questions, such as self-reported substance use and employment. We address the resulting challenges by specifying a target trial addressing three policy-relevant questions, regarding the impacts of hypothetical (rather than actual) interventions that would shift the mediators' distributions (separately, jointly or sequentially) to user-specified distributions that can be emulated with the observed data. We then define novel interventional effects that map to this trial, emulating shifts by setting mediators to random draws from those distributions. We show that estimation using a g-computation method is possible under an expanded set of causal assumptions relative to inference with well-defined interventions. These expanded assumptions reflect the lower level of evidence that is inevitable with ill-defined interventions. Application to the self-harm example using data from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study illustrates the value of our proposal for informing the design and evaluation of actual interventions in the future.

Previous studies have shown that both height and weight are positively associated with blood pressure. In children, however, the concurrent increases of height and weight have made it all but impossible to discern the effect of height from that of weight. To better understand these influences, we propose to examine the joint effect of height and weight on blood pressure. Bivariate thin plate spline surfaces are used to accommodate the potentially nonlinear effects as well as the interaction between height and weight. Moreover, we consider a joint model for paired blood pressure measures, that is, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, to account for the underlying correlation between the two measures within the same individual. The bivariate spline surfaces are allowed to vary across different groups of interest. We have developed related model fitting and inference procedures.

Learning models on event-based object classification have recently achieved massive success by accumulating sparse events into dense frames to apply traditional 2D learning methods. Yet, these approaches necessitate heavy-weight models and are with high computational complexity due to the redundant information introduced by the sparse-to-dense conversion, limiting the potential of event cameras on real-life applications. This study aims to address the core problem of balancing accuracy and model complexity for event-based classification models.

Some existing rendezvous algorithms can guarantee that rendezvous can be completed within finite time and they generate channel-hopping (CH) sequences based on the whole channel set. However, some channels may not be available (e.g., they are being used by the licensed users) and these existing algorithms would randomly replace the unavailable channels in the CH sequence. This random replacement is not effective, especially when the number of unavailable channels is large. In this paper, we design a new rendezvous algorithm that attempts rendezvous on the available channels only for faster rendezvous. This new algorithm, called Interleaved Sequences based on Available Channel set (ISAC), constructs an odd sub-sequence and an even sub-sequence and interleaves these two sub-sequences to compose a CH sequence. We prove that ISAC provides guaranteed rendezvous (i.e., rendezvous can be achieved within finite time). We derive the upper bound on the maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) to be O(m) (m is not greater than Q) under the symmetric model and O(mn) (n is not greater than Q) under the asymmetric model, where m and n are the number of available channels of two users and Q is the total number of channels (i.e., all potentially available channels).

These applications must simulate different complex material surfaces, various dynamic objects, and complex physical phenomena, increasing the complexity of VR scenes. Current computing devices cannot efficiently render these complex scenes in real time, and delayed rendering makes the content observed by the user inconsistent with the user's interaction, causing discomfort.   Foveated rendering is a promising technique that can accelerate rendering. It takes advantage of human eyes' inherent features and renders different regions with different qualities without sacrificing perceived visual quality.   Foveated rendering research has a history of 31 years and is mainly focused on solving the following three problems.   The first is to apply perceptual models of the human visual system into foveated rendering. The second is to render the image with different qualities according to foveation principles. The third is to integrate foveated rendering into existing rendering paradigms to improve rendering performance.   In this survey, we review foveated rendering research from 1990 to 2021.

We show that the electrical conductivity responds to the local strains that are generated by the mismatch between the thermal expansion of the polymeric and conductive phases and that the conductor-insulator transition is caused by a sudden and global disconnection of the electrical contacts forming the percolating network.

0000-0002-2051-440X,Yi Liu,"The University of Bristol, University of Bristol",LOGO: Video Text Spotting with Language Collaboration and Glyph   Perception Model,1970,"  Video text spotting (VTS) aims to simultaneously localize, recognize and track text instances in videos. To address the limited recognition capability of end-to-end methods, recent methods track the zero-shot results of state-of-the-art image text spotters directly, and achieve impressive performance. However, owing to the domain gap between different datasets, these methods usually obtain limited tracking trajectories on extreme dataset. Fine-tuning transformer-based text spotters on specific datasets could yield performance enhancements, albeit at the expense of considerable training resources. In this paper, we propose a Language Collaboration and Glyph Perception Model, termed LOGO, an innovative framework designed to enhance the performance of conventional text spotters. To achieve this goal, we design a language synergy classifier (LSC) to explicitly discern text instances from background noise in the recognition stage. Specially, the language synergy classifier can output text content or background code based on the legibility of text regions, thus computing language scores. Subsequently, fusion scores are computed by taking the average of detection scores and language scores, and are utilized to re-score the detection results before tracking. By the re-scoring mechanism, the proposed LSC facilitates the detection of low-resolution text instances while filtering out text-like regions. Moreover, the glyph supervision is introduced to enhance the recognition accuracy of noisy text regions. In addition, we propose the visual position mixture module, which can merge the position information and visual features efficiently, and acquire more discriminative tracking features. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2405.19194v2,Yes,innovative(1)

In this paper, we present a brief review on this rapidly developing field, mainly focusing on the superconducting properties of 1-UC FeSe/STO. Experimental evidences for the high-temperature superconductivity in 1-UC FeSe/STO, including the direct evidences revealed by transport and diamagnetic measurements, and other evidences from scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), are overviewed. Potential mechanisms of the enhanced superconductivity are discussed. There are accumulating arguments suggesting that the strengthened Cooper pairing in 1-UC FeSe/STO originates from the interface effects, specifically charge transfer and coupling to phonon modes in TiO2 plane. The study of superconductivity in 1-UC FeSe/STO not only sheds a new light on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductors with layered structures, but also provides the insight to explore new superconductors by interface engineering.

Existing machine unlearning techniques focus on centralized training, where access to all holders' training data is a must for the server to conduct the unlearning process. It remains largely underexplored about how to achieve unlearning when full access to all training data becomes unavailable. One noteworthy example is Federated Learning (FL), where each participating data holder trains locally, without sharing their training data to the central server. In this paper, we investigate the problem of machine unlearning in FL systems. We start with a formal definition of the unlearning problem in FL and propose a rapid retraining approach to fully erase data samples from a trained FL model. The resulting design allows data holders to jointly conduct the unlearning process efficiently while keeping their training data locally. Our formal convergence and complexity analysis demonstrate that our design can preserve model utility with high efficiency. Extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed realization.

Our framework categorizes evaluations into two distinct groups: first, focusing on image qualities such as aesthetics and realism, and second, examining text conditions through concept coverage and fairness. We introduce an innovative aesthetic score prediction model that assesses the visual appeal of generated images and unveils the first dataset marked with low-quality regions in generated human images to facilitate automatic defect detection. Our exploration into concept coverage probes the model's effectiveness in interpreting and rendering text-based concepts accurately, while our analysis of fairness reveals biases in model outputs, with an emphasis on gender, race, and age. While our study is grounded in human imagery, this dual-faceted approach is designed with the flexibility to be applicable to other forms of image generation, enhancing our understanding of generative models and paving the way to the next generation of more sophisticated, contextually aware, and ethically attuned generative models.

The detector is composed of many 1 cm * 1 cm * 20 cm plastic scintillator cuboids covered by 0.1 mm thick film of cadmium. The detector uses cadmium to absorb thermal neutrons and produce capture gamma-rays to indicate the detection of neutrons, and uses plastic scintillator to moderate neutrons and register gamma-rays. This design removes the volume competing relationship in traditional 3He counter-based fast neutron detectors, which hinders enhancement of the neutron detection efficiency. Detection efficiency of 21.66 +- 1.22% has been achieved with a 40.4 cm * 40.4 cm * 20 cm overall detector volume. This detector can measure both neutrons and gamma-rays simultaneously. A small detector (20.2 cm * 20.2 cm * 20 cm) demonstrated a 3.3 % false alarm rate for a 252Cf source with a neutron yield of 1841 n/s from 50 cm away within 15 seconds measurement time. It also demonstrated a very low (< 0.06%) false alarm rate for a 3.21 * 105 Bq 137Cs source.

With the development and prosperity of serverless computing, major cloud vendors have successively rolled out their commodity serverless computing platforms. However, the characteristics of these platforms have not been systematically studied. Measuring these characteristics can help developers to select the most adequate serverless computing platform and develop their serverless-based applications in the right way. To fill this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive study on characterizing mainstream commodity serverless computing platforms, including AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and Alibaba Cloud Function Compute. Specifically, we conduct both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative analysis, we compare these platforms from three aspects (i.e., development, deployment, and runtime) based on their official documentation to construct a taxonomy of characteristics. In quantitative analysis, we analyze the runtime performance of these platforms from multiple dimensions with well-designed benchmarks. First, we analyze three key factors that can influence the startup latency of serverless-based applications. Second, we compare the resource efficiency of different platforms with 16 representative benchmarks. Finally, we measure their performance difference when dealing with different concurrent requests, and explore the potential causes in a black-box fashion. Based on the results of both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we derive a series of findings and provide insightful implications for both developers and cloud vendors.

Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of ""jailbreaking"", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security.

0000-0002-2051-440X,Yi Liu,"The University of Bristol, University of Bristol",LIRE: listwise reward enhancement for preference alignment,1970,"  Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful content. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective and is widely adopted by researchers. However, implementing RLHF is complex, and its sensitivity to hyperparameters renders achieving stable performance and scalability challenging. Furthermore, prevailing approaches to preference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with limited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the potential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose a new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a gradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline rewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus eliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and seamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to multi-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm aimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments demonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several benchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to out-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human annotators.

The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern. This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor. Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability. To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model. Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses. Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B. In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively. This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq. Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs. ",https://doi.org/10.1145/3650212.3680304,2407.10106v3,Yes,potent(1)

Several performance optimizations have been proposed, including algorithm re-design to adapt to the thread parallelism, blocking strategies for memory access optimization, and the acceleration with the tensor core. In addition, we scale cuSpAMM to run on multiple GPUs with an effective load balance scheme. We evaluate cuSpAMM on both synthesized and real-world datasets on multiple GPUs. The experiment results show that cuSpAMM achieves significant performance speedup compared to vendor optimized cuBLAS and cuSPARSE libraries.

In building these models, data scientists need to take a stance on the legitimacy, authoritativeness and objectivity of the sources of ``truth"" used for model training and testing. This has political, ethical and epistemic implications which are rarely addressed in technical papers.

Specifically, the use of algorithmically differentiable non-sequential ray tracing provides an opportunity in the field of illumination design.

Additionally, substantial heterogeneity in the disease diagnosis between patients needs to be addressed for optimizing individualized treatment policy in order to achieve precision medicine. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated learning framework that can simultaneously learn patients' underlying mental states and recommend optimal treatments for each individual. This learning framework is based on the measurement theory in psychiatry for modeling multiple disease diagnostic measures as arising from the underlying causes (true mental states). It allows incorporation of the multivariate pre- and post-treatment outcomes as well as biological measures while preserving the invariant structure for representing patients' latent mental states. A multi-layer neural network is used to allow complex treatment effect heterogeneity. Optimal treatment policy can be inferred for future patients by comparing their potential mental states under different treatments given the observed multi-domain pre-treatment measurements. Experiments on simulated data and a real-world clinical trial data show that the learned treatment polices compare favorably to alternative methods on heterogeneous treatment effects, and have broad utilities which lead to better patient outcomes on multiple domains.

We introduce ""fracpairs"" as pairs subject to laws consistent with the use of the pair as a fraction, but do not exclude denominators to be zero. We investigate fracpairs over a reduced commutative ring (a commutative ring that has no nonzero nilpotent elements) and provide these with natural definitions for addition, multiplication, and additive and multiplicative inverse. We find that modulo a simple congruence these fracpairs constitute a ""common meadow"", which is a commutative monoid both for addition and multiplication, extended with a weak additive inverse, a multiplicative inverse except for zero, and an additional element ""a"" that is the image of the multiplicative inverse on zero and that propagates through all operations. Considering ""a"" as an error-value supports the intuition.   The equivalence classes of fracpairs thus obtained are called common cancellation fractions (cc-fractions), and cc-fractions over the integers constitute a homomorphic pre-image of the common meadow Qa, the field Q of rational numbers expanded with an a-totalized inverse. Moreover, the initial common meadow is isomorphic to the initial algebra of cc-fractions over the integer numbers. Next, we define canonical term algebras for cc-fractions over the integers and some meadows that model the rational numbers expanded with a totalized inverse, and provide some negative results concerning their associated term rewriting properties. Then we consider reduced commutative rings in which the sum of two squares plus one cannot be a zero divisor: by extending the equivalence relation on fracpairs we obtain an initial algebra that is isomorphic to Qa.

In this paper, we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances. We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE. More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve E2ERE.

The foundation of our framework is the derivation of an equivalent baseline correction for all of the existing control variates. Consequently, our framework enables us to characterize the variance-optimal unbiased estimator and provide a closed-form solution for it. This optimal estimator brings significantly improved performance in both evaluation and learning, and minimizes data requirements. Empirical observations corroborate our theoretical findings.

Approximately 3.2% uniaxial strain is required to achieve this anomalous threshold reduction for 1x1019 cm-3 n-type doping, and a complex interaction between uniaxial strain and n-type doping is observed. This anomalous threshold reduction represents a substantial performance advantage for uniaxially strained Ge lasers relative to other forms of Ge band engineering such as biaxial strain or tin alloying. Achieving this critical combination of uniaxial strain and doping for the anomalous threshold reduction is dramatically more relevant to practical devices than realizing a direct band gap.

However, existing benchmarks for tool use are inadequate, as they only cover tasks that require a simple sequence of API calls.   To remedy this gap, we built $\textbf{AppWorld Engine}$, a high-quality execution environment (60K lines of code) of 9 day-to-day apps operable via 457 APIs and populated with realistic digital activities simulating the lives of ~100 fictitious users. We then created $\textbf{AppWorld Benchmark}$ (40K lines of code), a suite of 750 natural, diverse, and challenging autonomous agent tasks requiring rich and interactive code generation. It supports robust programmatic evaluation with state-based unit tests, allowing for different ways of completing a task while also checking for unexpected changes, i.e., collateral damage. The state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4o, solves only ~49% of our 'normal' tasks and ~30% of 'challenge' tasks, while other models solve at least 16% fewer. This highlights the benchmark's difficulty and AppWorld's potential to push the frontiers of interactive coding agents. The project website is available at https://appworld.dev/.

In this paper, we present a germanium-based light emitter that encompasses all the aspects of potential low-threshold lasers: highly strained germanium gain medium, strain-induced pseudo-heterostructure, and high-Q optical cavity. Our light emitting structure presents greatly enhanced photoluminescence into cavity modes with measured quality factors of up to 2,000. The emission wavelength is tuned over more than 400 nm with a single lithography step. We find increased optical gain in optical cavities formed with germanium under high (>2.3%) tensile strain. Through quantitative analysis of gain/loss mechanisms, we find that free carrier absorption from the hole bands dominates the gain, resulting in no net gain even from highly strained, n-type doped germanium.

For the first time, we observe that the heterointerface presents no temperature dependence despite the two different conduction minimum valley locations of III-V ($\Gamma$-valley) and Ge (L-valley), which potentially stems from elastic trap-assisted tunneling through defect states at the interface generated by dislocations. The hetero-interface plays a dominant role in the overall $\rho_C$ below $\approx 1 \times 10^{-7} \Omega \cdot cm^2$, which can be further improved with large active dopant concentration in Ge by co-doping.

Despite several years of progress, however, all group IV lasers reported to date exhibit impractically high thresholds owing to their unfavorable bandstructures. Highly strained germanium with its fundamentally altered bandstructure has emerged as a potential low-threshold gain medium, but there has yet to be any successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising material system. Here, we demonstrate a low-threshold, compact group IV laser that employs germanium nanowire under a 1.6% uniaxial tensile strain as the gain medium. The amplified material gain in strained germanium can sufficiently surmount optical losses at 83 K, thus allowing the first observation of multimode lasing with an optical pumping threshold density of ~3.0 kW cm^-^2.

We illustrate the application of the method using the high density phase parametrization of the well known APR model in its pure neutron matter configuration as an example. We also show that, for models with only contact interactions, the adiabatic speed of sound is independent of the temperature in the limit of very large temperature. This feature is approximately valid for models with finite-range interactions as well, insofar as the temperature dependence they introduce to the Landau effective mass is weak. In addition, our study reveals that in first principle nonrelativistic models of hot and dense matter, contributions from higher than two-body interactions must be screened at high density to preserve causality.

This method does not address the poorly known surface tension between the two phases microscopically (as, for example, in the calculation of the core pasta phases via the Wigner-Seitz approximation) but instead combines the local and global charge neutrality conditions characteristic of the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions, respectively. Overall charge neutrality is achieved by dividing the leptons to those that obey local charge neutrality (Maxwell) and those that maintain global charge neutrality (Gibbs). The equation of state is obtained by using equilibrium constraints derived from minimizing the total energy density. The results of this minimization are then used to calculate neutron star mass-radius curves, tidal deformabilities, equilibrium and adiabatic sound speeds, and nonradial $g$-mode oscillation frequencies for several intermediate constructions. Various quantities of interest transform smoothly from their Gibbs structures to those of Maxwell as the local-to-total electron ratio $\eta$, introduced to mimic the hadron-to-quark interface tension from $0$ (Gibbs) to $\infty$ (Maxwell), is raised from $0$ to $1$. A notable exception is the $g$-mode frequency for the specific case of $\eta=1$ for which a gap appears between the quark and hadronic branches.

The formalism developed is applicable to a wide class of non-relativistic and relativistic models of hot and dense matter currently used in nuclear physics and astrophysics (supernovae, proto-neutron stars and neutron star mergers) as well as in condensed matter physics. We consider the general case of arbitrary dimensionality of momentum space and an arbitrary degree of relativity (for relativistic mean-field theoretical models). For non-relativistic zero-range interactions, knowledge of the Landau effective mass suffices to compute next-to-leading order effects, but in the case of finite-range interactions, momentum derivatives of the Landau effective mass function up to second order are required. Numerical computations are performed to compare results from our analytical formulas with the exact results for zero- and finite-range potential and relativistic mean-field theoretical models. In all cases, inclusion of next-to-leading order temperature effects substantially extends the ranges of partial degeneracy for which the analytical treatment remains valid.

This equation of state approximates the microscopic model calculations of Akmal and Pandharipande, which feature a neutral pion condensate. We treat the bulk homogeneous phase for isospin asymmetries ranging from symmetric nuclear matter to pure neutron matter and for temperatures and densities relevant for simulations of core-collapse supernovae, proto-neutron stars, and neutron star mergers. Numerical results of the state variables are compared with those of a typical Skyrme energy density functional with similar properties at nuclear densities, but which differs substantially at supra-nuclear densities. Analytical formulas, which are applicable to non-relativistic potential models such as the equations of state we are considering, are derived for all state variables and their thermodynamic derivatives. A highlight of our work is its focus on thermal response functions in the degenerate and non-degenerate situations, which allow checks of the numerical calculations for arbitrary degeneracy. These functions are sensitive to the density dependent effective masses of neutrons and protons, which determine the thermal properties in all regimes of degeneracy. We develop the ""thermal asymmetry free energy"" and establish its relation to the more commonly used nuclear symmetry energy. We also explore the role of the pion condensate at supra-nuclear densities and temperatures.

The transition to microservices has been highly motivated by the need for better alignment of technical design decisions with improving value potentials of architectures. Despite microservices' popularity, research still lacks disciplined understanding of transition and consensus on the principles and activities underlying ""micro-ing"" architectures.

We apply these methods to address specifically the energy spectrum and the scattering amplitude of these excitations in a transition between two hyperfine levels of the gas atoms. In particular, we exemplify the potential offered by these proposed techniques by contrasting the spectrum expected, from the {\it non conserving} Bogoliubov approximation valid for weak depletion, to the spectrum of the finite temperature extensions like the {\it conserving} generalized random phase approximation (GRPA). Both predict the existence of the Bogoliubov collective excitations but the GRPA approximation distinguishes them from the single atom excitations with a gapped and parabolic dispersion relation and accounts for the dynamical screening of any external perturbation applied to the gas. We propose two feasible experiments, one concerns the observation of the gap associated to this second branch of excitations and the other deals with this screening effect.

This effect is enhanced by an increasing bosonic filling factor leading to a large shift of the transition between the superfluid and the Mott-insulator phase.

This has the potential to overcome the primary limitations in cavity enhancement for atom interferometry, circumventing the cavity linewidth limit and enabling mode filtering, power enhancement, and a large beam diameter simultaneously. This approach combines a magnified linear cavity with an intracavity Pockels cell. The Pockels cell introduces a voltage tunable birefringence allowing the cavity mode frequencies to track the Raman lasers as they scan to compensate for gravitationally induced Doppler shifts, removing the dominant limitation of current cavity enhanced systems. A cavity is built to this geometry and shown to simultaneously realize the capability required for Doppler compensation, with a 5.04~mm $1/e^{2}$ diameter beam waist and an enhancement factor of $>$5x at a finesse of 35. Furthermore, this has a tunable Gouy phase, allowing the suppression of higher order spatial modes and the avoidance of regions of instability. This approach can therefore enable enhanced contrast and longer atom interferometry times while also enabling the key features of cavity enhanced atom interferometry, power enhancement and the reduction of aberrations.

This simple model plays pivotal roles in understanding more complicated processes. The presented analytical solution serves as a test of numerical integration schemes, its derivation is presented in a fashion that allows to be repeated directly in a classroom. While the results in the absence of fields (equilibrium) or confinement (free particle) are omnipresent in the literature, we write down, apparently for the first time, the full nonequilibrium results that may correspond, e.g., to a Hookean dumbbell embedded in a macroscopically homogeneous shear or mixed flow field.

While PTAs may detect a stochastic gravitational-wave background from a population of MBHBs, during operation LISA will detect individual merging MBHBs. To demonstrate the profound interplay between LISA and PTAs, we estimate the number of MBHB mergers that one can expect to observe with LISA by extrapolating direct observational constraints on the MBHB merger rate inferred from PTA data. For this, we postulate that the common signal observed by PTAs (and consistent with the increased evidence recently reported) is an astrophysical background sourced by a single MBHB population. We then constrain the LISA detection rate, $\mathcal{R}$, in the mass-redshift space by combining our Bayesian-inferred merger rate with LISA's sensitivity to spin-aligned, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms.

We investigate how well we could hope to measure properties of these binaries using the Advanced LIGO detectors, which began operation in September 2015. We study an astrophysically motivated population of sources (binary components with masses $1.2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$--$1.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and spins of less than $0.05$) using the full LIGO analysis pipeline. While this simulated population covers the observed range of potential binary neutron-star sources, we do not exclude the possibility of sources with parameters outside these ranges; given the existing uncertainty in distributions of mass and spin, it is critical that analyses account for the full range of possible mass and spin configurations. We find that conservative prior assumptions on neutron-star mass and spin lead to average fractional uncertainties in component masses of $\sim 16\%$, with little constraint on spins (the median $90\%$ upper limit on the spin of the more massive component is $\sim 0.7$). Stronger prior constraints on neutron-star spins can further constrain mass estimates, but only marginally. However, we find that the sky position and luminosity distance for these sources are not influenced by the inclusion of spin; therefore, if LIGO detects a low-spin population of BNS sources, less computationally expensive results calculated neglecting spin will be sufficient for guiding electromagnetic follow-up.

Here we report density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the Born-Szigeti theory of pyroelectricity, by combining fundamental thermodynamics and the modern theory of polarization. We find satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the case of bulk benchmark materials, showing that the so-called electron-phonon renormalization, whose contribution has been viewed as negligible, is important. We predict out-of-plane pyroelectricity in the recently synthesized Janus MoSSe monolayer and in-plane pyroelectricity in the group-IV monochalcogenide GeS monolayer. It is notable that the so-called secondary pyroelectricity is found to be dominant in GeS monolayer.

A measure of the effectiveness of an engine is the velocity the engine is able to produce at a given force, the force-velocity curve. One type of force-velocity curve, consisting of a concave region where velocity is insensitive to increasing force followed by a decrease in velocity, is indicative of an adaptive response. In contrast, an engine whose velocity rapidly decays as a convex curve in response to increasing force would indicate a lack of adaptive response. Even taken outside of a cellular context, branching actin networks have been observed to exhibit both concave and convex force-velocity curves. The exact mechanism that can explain both force-velocity curves is not yet known. We carried out an agent-based stochastic simulation to explore such a mechanism. Our results suggest that upon loading, branching actin networks are capable of remodeling by increasing the number filaments growing against the load. Our model provides a mechanism that can account for both convex and concave force-velocity relationships observed in branching actin networks. Finally, our model gives a potential explanation to the experimentally observed force history dependence for actin network velocity. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1111.6611v1,Yes,potent(1)

Such studies benefit from the active control of spin orientation in any solid, which is yet known to rarely take place in the two-dimensional (2D) limit.

In this paper, we delve into the distinction between layer attention and the general attention mechanism, noting that existing layer attention methods achieve layer interaction on fixed feature maps in a static manner. These static layer attention methods limit the ability for context feature extraction among layers. To restore the dynamic context representation capability of the attention mechanism, we propose a Dynamic Layer Attention (DLA) architecture. The DLA comprises dual paths, where the forward path utilizes an improved recurrent neural network block, named Dynamic Sharing Unit (DSU), for context feature extraction. The backward path updates features using these shared context representations. Finally, the attention mechanism is applied to these dynamically refreshed feature maps among layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLA architecture, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in image recognition and object detection tasks. Additionally, the DSU block has been evaluated as an efficient plugin in the proposed DLA architecture.The code is available at https://github.com/tunantu/Dynamic-Layer-Attention.

The attacks causing such incidents commonly commence with the deployment of adversarial contracts, subsequently leveraging these contracts to execute adversarial transactions that exploit vulnerabilities in victim contracts. Existing defense mechanisms leverage heuristic or machine learning algorithms to detect adversarial transactions, but they face significant challenges in detecting private adversarial transactions. Namely, attackers can send adversarial transactions directly to miners, evading visibility within the blockchain network and effectively bypassing the detection. In this paper, we propose a new direction for detecting DeFi attacks, i.e., detecting adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions, allowing us to proactively identify potential attack intentions, even if they employ private adversarial transactions. Specifically, we observe that most adversarial contracts follow a similar pattern, e.g., anonymous fund source, closed-source, frequent token-related function calls. Based on this observation, we build a machine learning classifier that can effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones. We build a dataset consists of features extracted from 269 adversarial contracts and 13,000 benign contracts. Based on this dataset, we evaluate different classifiers, the results of which show that our method for identifying DeFi adversarial contracts performs exceptionally well.

However, prevalent MVF model architecture often amalgamates CVS signals from the same temporal step but different views into a unified representation, disregarding the asynchronous nature of cardiovascular events and the inherent heterogeneity across views, leading to catastrophic view confusion. Efficient training strategies specifically tailored for MVF models to attain comprehensive representations need simultaneous consideration. Crucially, real-world data frequently arrives with incomplete views, an aspect rarely noticed by researchers. Thus, the View-Centric Transformer (VCT) and Multitask Masked Autoencoder (M2AE) are specifically designed to emphasize the centrality of each view and harness unlabeled data to achieve superior fused representations. Additionally, we systematically define the missing-view problem for the first time and introduce prompt techniques to aid pretrained MVF models in flexibly adapting to various missing-view scenarios. Rigorous experiments involving atrial fibrillation detection, blood pressure estimation, and sleep staging-typical health monitoring tasks-demonstrate the remarkable advantage of our method in MVF compared to prevailing methodologies. Notably, the prompt technique requires finetuning less than 3% of the entire model's data, substantially fortifying the model's resilience to view missing while circumventing the need for complete retraining.

The functionality of ferroelectrics depends critically on the dynamics of polarization switching in response to an external electric/stress field. Unlike the switching dynamics in bulk ferroelectrics that have been extensively studied, the mechanisms and dynamics of polarization switching in 2D remain largely unexplored. Molecular dynamics (MD) using classical force fields is a reliable and efficient method for large-scale simulations of dynamical processes with atomic resolution. Here we developed a deep neural network-based force field of monolayer In$_2$Se$_3$ using a concurrent learning procedure that efficiently updates the first-principles-based training database.

However, the susceptibility of the measurement error of one or more magnetic measurement units (MMUs) within the current sensor to drift significantly from the nominal value due to environmental factors poses a potential threat to the measurement accuracy of the current sensor. In light of the need to ensure sustained measurement accuracy over the long term, this paper proposes an innovative self-healing approach rooted in cyber-physics correlation. This approach aims to identify MMUs exhibiting abnormal measurement errors, allowing for the exclusive utilization of the remaining unaffected MMUs in the current measurement process. To achieve this, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to discern the primary component, arising from fluctuations of the measured current, from the residual component, attributed to the drift in measurement error. This analysis is conducted by scrutinizing the measured data obtained from the MMUs. Subsequently, the squared prediction error (SPE) statistic (also called $Q$ statistic) is deployed to individually identify any MMU displaying abnormal behavior. The experimental results demonstrate the successful online identification of abnormal MMUs without the need for a standard magnetic field sensor. By eliminating the contributions from the identified abnormal MMUs, the accuracy of the current measurement is effectively preserved.

However, the difficulty of obtaining such templates actually hinders the practical application of SPG models. For one thing, the prohibitive cost makes it unfeasible to manually design decent templates for every source sentence. For another, the templates automatically retrieved by current heuristic methods are usually unreliable for SPG models to generate qualified paraphrases. To escape this dilemma, we propose a novel Quality-based Syntactic Template Retriever (QSTR) to retrieve templates based on the quality of the to-be-generated paraphrases. Furthermore, for situations requiring multiple paraphrases for each source sentence, we design a Diverse Templates Search (DTS) algorithm, which can enhance the diversity between paraphrases without sacrificing quality. Experiments demonstrate that QSTR can significantly surpass existing retrieval methods in generating high-quality paraphrases and even perform comparably with human-annotated templates in terms of reference-free metrics. Additionally, human evaluation and the performance on downstream tasks using our generated paraphrases for data augmentation showcase the potential of our QSTR and DTS algorithm in practical scenarios.

However, these previous studies have focused on either simple one-step cost/benefit criteria, or on discrete underlying state spaces. In this work, we first propose a natural continuous representation of population state, governed by the Beta distribution, using a loan granting setting as a running example. Next, we apply a model of population dynamics under lending decisions, and show that when conditional payback probabilities are estimated correctly 1) ``optimal'' behavior by lenders can lead to ''Matthew Effect'' bifurcations (i.e., ''the rich get richer and the poor get poorer''), but that 2) many common fairness constraints on the allowable policies cause groups to converge to the same equilibrium point. Last, we contrast our results in the case of misspecified conditional probability estimates with prior work, and show that for this model, different levels of group misestimation guarantees that even fair policies lead to bifurcations.

0000-0001-5917-4185,Joshua Williams,"University of Leeds, University of Leeds Faculty of Environment",A Bayesian Model of Cash Bail Decisions,1970,"  The use of cash bail as a mechanism for detaining defendants pre-trial is an often-criticized system that many have argued violates the presumption of ""innocent until proven guilty."" Many studies have sought to understand both the long-term effects of cash bail's use and the disparate rate of cash bail assignments along demographic lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is often susceptible to problems of infra-marginality -- that the data we observe can only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the marginal decision.   In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail decisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs of assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the distribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different races.

With shielding and fifth force parameters in a similar range as in previous studies of Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars we find clear effects on stellar luminosity and flux-weighted gravity. The relationship between flux weighted gravity, g_F = g/Teff^4, and bolometric magnitude M_bol (FGLR), which has been used successfully for accurate distance determinations, is systematically affected. While the stellar evolution FGLRs show a systematic offset from the observed relation, we can use the differential shifts between models with Newtonian and modified gravity to estimate the influence on FGLR distance determinations. Modified gravity leads to a distance increase of 0.05 to 0.15 magnitudes in distance modulus. These change are comparable to the ones found for Cepheid stars. We compare observed FGLR and TRGB distances of nine galaxies to constrain the free parameters of modified gravity.

Often pairwise text preferences are used: given two texts, human (or AI) annotators select the ""better"" one. Such feedback data is widely used to align models to human preferences (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), or to rank models according to human preferences (e.g., Chatbot Arena). Despite its wide-spread use, prior work has demonstrated that human-annotated pairwise text preference data often exhibits unintended biases. For example, human annotators have been shown to prefer assertive over truthful texts in certain contexts. Models trained or evaluated on this data may implicitly encode these biases in a manner hard to identify. In this paper, we formulate the interpretation of existing pairwise text preference data as a compression task: the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) problem. In constitutional AI, a set of principles (or constitution) is used to provide feedback and fine-tune AI models. The ICAI problem inverts this process: given a dataset of feedback, we aim to extract a constitution that best enables a large language model (LLM) to reconstruct the original annotations. We propose a corresponding initial ICAI algorithm and validate its generated constitutions quantitatively based on reconstructed annotations. Generated constitutions have many potential use-cases -- they may help identify undesirable biases, scale feedback to unseen data or assist with adapting LLMs to individual user preferences. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of datasets: (a) synthetic feedback datasets with known underlying principles; (b) the AlpacaEval dataset of cross-annotated human feedback; and (c) the crowdsourced Chatbot Arena data set.

Empirical analyses of high-dimensional biomedical data, including genomics, proteomics, microbiome, and neuroimaging, among others, consistently reveal strong modularity in the dependence patterns. In these analyses, intercorrelated high-dimensional biomedical features often form communities or modules that can be interconnected with others. While the interconnected community structure has been extensively studied in biomedical research (e.g., gene co-expression networks), its potential to assist in the estimation of covariance matrices remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a procedure that leverages the commonly observed interconnected community structure in high-dimensional biomedical data to estimate large covariance and precision matrices. We derive the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators for covariance and precision matrices in closed forms and provide theoretical results on their asymptotic properties.

We use the metric Age-of-Information (AoI) to evaluate information freshness. An efficient solution to minimize the AoI for the MEC system with multiple users is non-trivial to obtain due to the random computing time. In this paper, we consider multiple users offloading tasks to heterogeneous edge servers in a MEC system. We first reformulate the problem as a Restless Multi-Arm-Bandit (RMAB) problem and establish a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) to characterize the updating of AoI for the MEC system. Based on the hierarchical MDP, we propose a nested index framework and design a nested index policy with provably asymptotic optimality. Finally, the closed form of the nested index is obtained, which enables the performance tradeoffs between computation complexity and accuracy. Our algorithm leads to an optimality gap reduction of up to 40%, compared to benchmarks. Our algorithm asymptotically approximates the lower bound as the system scalar gets large enough.

The continuous growth in scale of deep SNNs poses challenges for model deployment. Network pruning reduces hardware resource requirements of model deployment by compressing the network scale. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because the pruning iterations amplify the training difficulty of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience, we propose a regeneration mechanism based on the neuron criticality for SNN pruning to enhance feature extraction and accelerate the pruning process. Firstly, we propose a low-cost metric for the criticality in SNNs. Then, we re-rank the pruned structures after pruning and regenerate those with higher criticality to obtain the critical network. Our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26% reduction of pruning cost.

A numerical study illustrates finite sample performance of the proposed method. An application of the method shows that the residual spectrum can effectively detect brain connectivity.

However, recent studies show the possibilities of penetrating NAT boxes in some specific circumstances. The penetrated NAT box can be exploited by attackers as a pivot to abuse the otherwise inaccessible internal network resources, leading to serious security consequences. In this paper, we aim to conduct an Internet-wide penetration testing on NAT boxes. The main difference between our study and the previous ones is that ours is based on the TCP/IP side channels. We explore the TCP/IP side channels in the research literature, and find that the shared-IPID side channel is the most suitable for NAT-penetration testing, as it satisfies the three requirements of our study: generality, ethics, and robustness. Based on this side channel, we develop an adaptive scanner that can accomplish the Internet-wide scanning in 5 days in a very non-aggressive manner. The evaluation shows that our scanner is effective in both the controlled network and the real network.

In this study, we aim to investigate the potential influence of alcohol intake frequency on accelerated brain ageing by estimating the mean potential brain-age gap (BAG) index, the difference between brain age and actual age, under different alcohol intake frequencies in a large UK Biobank (UKB) cohort with extensive phenomic data reflecting a comprehensive life-style profile. We face two major challenges: (1) a large number of phenomic variables as potential confounders and (2) a small proportion of participants with complete phenomic data. To address these challenges, we first develop a new ensemble learning framework to establish robust estimation of mean potential outcome in the presence of many confounders. We then construct a data integration step to borrow information from UKB participants with incomplete phenomic data to improve efficiency.

Regression models are commonly employed to investigate these effects, treating metabolomics features as the outcomes and alcohol intake as the exposure. Given the latent dependence structure among the numerous metabolomic features (e.g., co-expression networks with interconnected modules), modeling this structure is crucial for accurately identifying metabolomic features associated with alcohol intake. However, integrating dependence structures into regression models remains difficult in both estimation and inference procedures due to their large or high dimensionality. To bridge this gap, we propose an innovative multivariate regression model that accounts for correlations among outcome features by incorporating an interconnected community structure. Furthermore, we derive closed-form and likelihood-based estimators, accompanied by explicit exact and explicit asymptotic covariance matrix estimators, respectively. Simulation analysis demonstrates that our approach provides accurate estimation of both dependence and regression coefficients, and enhances sensitivity while maintaining a well-controlled discovery rate, as evidenced through benchmarking against existing regression models.

These techniques incur no additional cost and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained feed-forward models to enhance their robustness against the inconsistency of generated multi-view images.

Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts, neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework, which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images. Specifically, our framework consists of two distinct stages. In the initial stage, we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels. After pre-training, we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder. In the subsequent stage, the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits. Further, we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence, encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts. The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data, enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain. Finally, the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP, and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student.

0000-0001-7305-3793,Shuo Chen,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit辰t M端nchen,Avalon's Game of Thoughts: Battle Against Deception through Recursive   Contemplation,1970,"  Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have brought remarkable success in the field of LLM-as-Agent. Nevertheless, a prevalent assumption is that the information processed by LLMs is consistently honest, neglecting the pervasive deceptive or misleading information in human society and AI-generated content. This oversight makes LLMs susceptible to malicious manipulations, potentially resulting in detrimental outcomes. This study utilizes the intricate Avalon game as a testbed to explore LLMs' potential in deceptive environments. Avalon, full of misinformation and requiring sophisticated logic, manifests as a ""Game-of-Thoughts"". Inspired by the efficacy of humans' recursive thinking and perspective-taking in the Avalon game, we introduce a novel framework, Recursive Contemplation (ReCon), to enhance LLMs' ability to identify and counteract deceptive information. ReCon combines formulation and refinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial thoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them. Additionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective transitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order allows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order involves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After integrating ReCon with different LLMs, extensive experiment results from the Avalon game indicate its efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around deceptive information without extra fine-tuning and data. Finally, we offer a possible explanation for the efficacy of ReCon and explore the current limitations of LLMs in terms of safety, reasoning, speaking style, and format, potentially furnishing insights for subsequent research.

However, the realization of such hybrid circuits has remained a challenge because it requires optical communication at nanometer scales. A major challenge to this integration is the identification of a suitable material. After discussing the material aspect of the challenge, we identified atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as a perfect material platform to implement the circuit. The selection of TMDs is based on their very distinct property: monolayer TMDs are able to emit and absorb light at the same wavelength determined by direct exciton transitions. To prove the concept, we fabricated simple devices consisting of silver nanowires as plasmonic waveguides and monolayer TMDs as active optoelectronic media. Using photoexcitation, direct optical imaging and spectral analysis, we demonstrated generation and detection of surface plasmon polaritons by monolayer TMDs. Regarded as novel materials for electronics and photonics, transition metal dichalcogenides are expected to find new applications in next generation integrated circuits.

The increasing scale of problems today underscores the need to understand statistical inference in these models when the number of subjects diverges, a topic currently lacking in the literature except in a few special instances. To partially address this gap, this paper establishes a near-optimal asymptotic normality result for the maximum likelihood estimator in a broad class of pairwise comparison models, as well as a non-asymptotic convergence rate for each individual subject under comparison. The key idea lies in identifying the Fisher information matrix as a weighted graph Laplacian, which can be studied via a meticulous spectral analysis. Our findings provide a unified theory for performing statistical inference in a wide range of pairwise comparison models beyond the Bradley--Terry model, benefiting practitioners with theoretical guarantees for their use. Simulations utilizing synthetic data are conducted to validate the asymptotic normality result, followed by a hypothesis test using a tennis competition dataset.

These systems utilize LiDAR sensors mounted on vehicles to capture vast cityscapes. However, a significant challenge arises due to occlusions caused by roadside parked vehicles, leading to the loss of scene information, particularly on the roads, sidewalks, curbs, and the lower sections of buildings. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn a model capable of filling gaps in urban scenes that are obscured by vehicle occlusion. We have developed an innovative technique where we place virtual vehicle models along road boundaries in the gap-free scene and utilize a ray-casting algorithm to create a new scene with occluded gaps. This allows us to generate diverse and realistic urban point cloud scenes with and without vehicle occlusion, surpassing the limitations of real-world training data collection and annotation. Furthermore, we introduce the Scene Gap Completion Network (SGC-Net), an end-to-end model that can generate well-defined shape boundaries and smooth surfaces within occluded gaps. The experiment results reveal that 97.66% of the filled points fall within a range of 5 centimeters relative to the high-density ground truth point cloud scene. These findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed model in gap completion and reconstructing urban scenes affected by vehicle occlusions.

In this paper, we propose to leverage sensing to enhance physical layer security (PLS) in multiuser communication systems in the presence of a suspicious target. To this end, we develop a two-phase framework to first estimate the location of the potential eavesdropper by sensing and then utilize the estimated information to enhance PLS for communication. In particular, in the first phase, a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) base station (BS) exploits a sensing signal to mitigate the sensing information uncertainty of the potential eavesdropper. Then, in the second phase, to facilitate joint sensing and secure communication, the DFRC BS employs beamforming and artificial noise to enhance secure communication. The design objective is to maximize the system sum rate while alleviating the information leakage by jointly optimizing the time allocation and beamforming policy. Capitalizing on monotonic optimization theory, we develop a two-layer globally optimal algorithm to reveal the performance upper bound of the considered system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a significant sum rate gain over two baseline schemes that adopt existing techniques. Moreover, our results unveil that ISAC is a promising paradigm for enhancing secure communication in wireless networks. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2312.15231v1,Yes,potent(2)

One promising approach to meet this demand is to employ network-level integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by jointly designing the signal processing and resource allocation over the entire network. However, to unleash the full potential of network-level ISAC, some critical challenges must be tackled. Among them, interference management is one of the most significant ones. In this article, we build up a bridge between interference mitigation techniques and the corresponding optimization methods, which facilitates efficient interference mitigation in network-level ISAC systems. In particular, we first identify several types of interference in network-level ISAC systems, including self-interference, mutual interference, crosstalk, clutter, and multiuser interference. Then, we present several promising techniques that can be utilized to suppress specific types of interference. For each type of interference, we discuss the corresponding problem formulation and identify the associated optimization methods. Moreover, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed interference mitigation techniques, two concrete network-level ISAC systems, namely coordinated cellular network-based and distributed antenna-based ISAC systems, are investigated from interference management perspective. Experiment results indicate that it is beneficial to collaboratively employ different interference mitigation techniques and leverage the network structure to achieve the full potential of network-level ISAC.

We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter. ",https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2013/02/004,1203.3542v3,Yes,potent(1)

The General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) data are a possible source for examining micromobility trip patterns, but efforts are needed to infer trips from the GBFS data. Existing trip inference methods are usually based upon the assumption that the vehicle ID of a micromobility option (e-scooter or e-bike) does not change, and so they cannot deal with data with vehicle IDs that change over time. In this study, we propose a comprehensive package of algorithms to infer trip origins and destinations from GBFS data with different types of vehicle ID. We implement the algorithms in Washington DC by analyzing one-week (last week of February 2020) of GBFS data published by six vendors, and we evaluate the inference accuracy of the proposed algorithms by R-squared, mean absolute error, and sum absolute error. We find that the R-squared measure is larger than 0.9 and the MAE measure is smaller than 2 when the algorithms are evaluated with a 400m*400m grid, and the absolute errors are relatively larger in the downtown area.

We present a setup for trARPES with 22.3 eV extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) femtosecond pulses at 50-kHz repetition rate, which enables fast data acquisition and access to dynamics across momentum space with high sensitivity. The design and operation of the XUV beamline, pump-probe setup, and UHV endstation are described in detail. By characterizing the effect of space-charge broadening, we determine an ultimate source-limited energy resolution of 60 meV, with typically 80-100 meV obtained at 1-2e10 photons/s probe flux on the sample. The instrument capabilities are demonstrated via both equilibrium and time-resolved ARPES studies of transition-metal dichalcogenides. The 50-kHz repetition rate enables sensitive measurements of quasiparticles at low excitation fluences in semiconducting MoSe$_2$, with an instrumental time resolution of 65 fs. Moreover, photo-induced phase transitions can be driven with the available pump fluence, as shown by charge density wave melting in 1T-TiSe$_2$. The high repetition-rate setup thus provides a versatile platform for sensitive XUV trARPES, from quenching of electronic phases down to the perturbative limit.

In this paper we introduce and define a new methodological paradigm we call design by immersion, which provides an alternative perspective on problem-driven visualization work. Design by immersion embeds transdisciplinary experiences at the center of the visualization process by having visualization researchers participate in the work of the target domain (or domain experts participate in visualization research). Based on our own combined experiences of working on cross-disciplinary, problem-driven visualization projects, we present six case studies that expose the opportunities that design by immersion enables, including (1) exploring new domain-inspired visualization design spaces, (2) enriching domain understanding through personal experiences, and (3) building strong transdisciplinary relationships.

As we grow closer to mass adoption of everyday Extended Reality (XR), which is frequently leveraging perceptual limitations (e.g., redirected walking), it becomes pertinent to consider how XR could leverage memory limitations (forgetting, distorting, persistence) to induce memory manipulations. As memories highly impact our self-perception, social interactions, and behaviors, there is a pressing need to understand XR Memory Manipulations (XRMMs). We ran three speculative design workshops (n=12), with XR and memory researchers creating 48 XRMM scenarios. Through thematic analysis, we define XRMMs, present a framework of their core components and reveal three classes (at encoding, pre-retrieval, at retrieval).

The lower bounds are achieved by schemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap coding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more generally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak receivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and large cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff for this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy capacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the legitimate receivers with cache memories. Moreover, they show that the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff can be significantly smaller than its non-secure counterpart, but it grows much faster when cache memories are small. The paper also presents a lower bound on the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff where one is allowed to optimize the cache assignment subject to a total cache budget. It is close to the best known lower bound without secrecy constraint. For small total cache budget, the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff is achieved by assigning all the available cache memory uniformly over all receivers if the eavesdropper is stronger than all legitimate receivers, and it is achieved by assigning the cache memory uniformly only over the weak receivers if the eavesdropper is weaker than the strong receivers.

Our reduction allows us to use a broad range of algorithms developed for the hard-core model to sample from the Gibbs point process and approximate its partition function. This is, to the extend of our knowledge, the first approach that deals with pair potentials of unbounded range.

These measurements unequivocally demonstrate that quantum dot lasers on silicon readily and stably generate a more extensive repertoire of nonlinear dynamics compared to quantum well lasers.

However, they may suffer from unbalanced covariates for realized treatment assignments. Rerandomization, a design that rerandomizes the treatment assignment until a prespecified covariate balance criterion is met, has recently got attention due to its easy implementation, improved covariate balance and more efficient inference. Researchers have then suggested to use the treatment assignments that minimize the covariate imbalance, namely the optimally balanced design. This has caused again the long-time controversy between two philosophies for designing experiments: randomization versus optimal and thus almost deterministic designs. Existing literature argued that rerandomization with overly balanced observed covariates can lead to highly imbalanced unobserved covariates, making it vulnerable to model misspecification. On the contrary, rerandomization with properly balanced covariates can provide robust inference for treatment effects while sacrificing some efficiency compared to the ideally optimal design. In this paper, we show it is possible that, by making the covariate imbalance diminishing at a proper rate as the sample size increases, rerandomization can achieve its ideally optimal precision that one can expect with perfectly balanced covariates, while still maintaining its robustness. We further investigate conditions on the number of covariates for achieving the desired optimality. Our results rely on a more delicate asymptotic analysis for rerandomization. The derived theory for rerandomization provides a deeper understanding of its large-sample property and can better guide its practical implementation. Furthermore, it also helps reconcile the controversy between randomized and optimal designs in an asymptotic sense. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2109.02578v2,Yes,potent(1)

Existing methods for this problem typically assume some form of sparsity for the regression functions. In this work, we introduce a debiased inverse propensity score weighting (DIPW) scheme for average treatment effect estimation that delivers $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimates when the propensity score follows a sparse logistic regression model; the outcome regression functions are permitted to be arbitrarily complex. We further demonstrate how confidence intervals centred on our estimates may be constructed. Our theoretical results quantify the price to pay for permitting the regression functions to be unestimable, which shows up as an inflation of the variance of the estimator compared to the semiparametric efficient variance by a constant factor, under mild conditions. We also show that when outcome regressions can be estimated faster than a slow $1/\sqrt{ \log n}$ rate, our estimator achieves semiparametric efficiency. As our results accommodate arbitrary outcome regression functions, averages of transformed responses under each treatment may also be estimated at the $\sqrt{n}$ rate. Thus, for example, the variances of the potential outcomes may be estimated. We discuss extensions to estimating linear projections of the heterogeneous treatment effect function and explain how propensity score models with more general link functions may be handled within our framework.

When the covariate information for each experimental candidate is available, one typical way is to include them in covariate adjustments for more accurate treatment effect estimation. In this paper, we investigate this problem under the randomization-based framework, i.e., that the covariates and potential outcomes of all experimental candidates are assumed as deterministic quantities and the randomness comes solely from the treatment assignment mechanism. Under this framework, to achieve asymptotically valid inference, existing estimators usually require either (i) that the dimension of covariates $p$ grows at a rate no faster than $O(n^{2 / 3})$ as sample size $n \to \infty$; or (ii) certain sparsity constraints on the linear representations of potential outcomes constructed via possibly high-dimensional covariates. In this paper, we consider the moderately high-dimensional regime where $p$ is allowed to be in the same order of magnitude as $n$. We develop a novel debiased estimator with a corresponding inference procedure and establish its asymptotic normality under mild assumptions. Our estimator is model-free and does not require any sparsity constraint on potential outcome's linear representations. We also discuss its asymptotic efficiency improvements over the unadjusted treatment effect estimator under different dimensionality constraints. Numerical analysis confirms that compared to other regression adjustment based treatment effect estimators, our debiased estimator performs well in moderately high dimensions.

While it has tremendous potential to promote the image colorization task, the performance is limited owing to the high-dimension of data manifold and model capability. This study presents a novel scheme that exploits the score-based generative model in wavelet domain to address the issues. By taking advantage of the multi-scale and multi-channel representation via wavelet transform, the proposed model learns the richer priors from stacked coarse and detailed wavelet coefficient components jointly and effectively. This strategy also reduces the dimension of the original manifold and alleviates the curse of dimensionality, which is beneficial for estimation and sampling. Moreover, dual consistency terms in the wavelet domain, namely data-consistency and structure-consistency are devised to leverage colorization task better. Specifically, in the training phase, a set of multi-channel tensors consisting of wavelet coefficients is used as the input to train the network with denoising score matching. In the inference phase, samples are iteratively generated via annealed Langevin dynamics with data and structure consistencies.

In this article, we propose a method of using artificial intelligence to expand the channel to achieve the goal of generating the virtual coils. The main characteristic of our work is utilizing dummy variable technology to expand/extrapolate the receive coils in both image and k-space domains. The high-dimensional information formed by channel expansion is used as the prior information to improve the reconstruction effect of parallel imaging. Two main components are incorporated into the network design, namely variable augmentation technology and sum of squares (SOS) objective function. Variable augmentation provides the network with more high-dimensional prior information, which is helpful for the network to extract the deep feature information of the data. The SOS objective function is employed to solve the deficiency of k-space data training while speeding up convergence. Experimental results demonstrated its great potentials in super-resolution of MR images and accelerated parallel imaging reconstruction. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2201.07540v2,Yes,potent(1)

Previous works mainly focus on the performance of medical knowledge with examinations, which is far from the realistic scenarios, falling short in assessing the abilities of LLMs on clinical tasks. In the quest to enhance the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, this paper introduces the Automated Interactive Evaluation (AIE) framework and the State-Aware Patient Simulator (SAPS), targeting the gap between traditional LLM evaluations and the nuanced demands of clinical practice. Unlike prior methods that rely on static medical knowledge assessments, AIE and SAPS provide a dynamic, realistic platform for assessing LLMs through multi-turn doctor-patient simulations. This approach offers a closer approximation to real clinical scenarios and allows for a detailed analysis of LLM behaviors in response to complex patient interactions. Our extensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the AIE framework, with outcomes that align well with human evaluations, underscoring its potential to revolutionize medical LLM testing for improved healthcare delivery.

Previous benchmarks only focus on the capacity of the MLLMs in medical visual question-answering (VQA) or report generation and fail to assess the performance of the MLLMs on complex clinical multi-modal tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Medical Personalized Multi-modal Consultation (Med-PMC) paradigm to evaluate the clinical capacity of the MLLMs. Med-PMC builds a simulated clinical environment where the MLLMs are required to interact with a patient simulator to complete the multi-modal information-gathering and decision-making task. Specifically, the patient simulator is decorated with personalized actors to simulate diverse patients in real scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments to access 12 types of MLLMs, providing a comprehensive view of the MLLMs' clinical performance. We found that current MLLMs fail to gather multimodal information and show potential bias in the decision-making task when consulted with the personalized patient simulators.

In contrast, multi-modal object ReID utilizes complementary information from diverse modalities, showing great potentials for practical applications. However, previous methods may be easily affected by irrelevant backgrounds and usually ignore the modality gaps. To address above issues, we propose a novel learning framework named \textbf{EDITOR} to select diverse tokens from vision Transformers for multi-modal object ReID. We begin with a shared vision Transformer to extract tokenized features from different input modalities. Then, we introduce a Spatial-Frequency Token Selection (SFTS) module to adaptively select object-centric tokens with both spatial and frequency information. Afterwards, we employ a Hierarchical Masked Aggregation (HMA) module to facilitate feature interactions within and across modalities. Finally, to further reduce the effect of backgrounds, we propose a Background Consistency Constraint (BCC) and an Object-Centric Feature Refinement (OCFR). They are formulated as two new loss functions, which improve the feature discrimination with background suppression. As a result, our framework can generate more discriminative features for multi-modal object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our methods.

Neural network pruning, as one of the mainstream model compression techniques, is under extensive study to reduce the number of parameters and computations. In contrast to irregular pruning that incurs high index storage and decoding overhead, structured pruning techniques have been proposed as the promising solutions. However, prior studies on structured pruning tackle the problem mainly from the perspective of facilitating hardware implementation, without analyzing the characteristics of sparse neural networks. The neglect on the study of sparse neural networks causes inefficient trade-off between regularity and pruning ratio. Consequently, the potential of structurally pruning neural networks is not sufficiently mined.   In this work, we examine the structural characteristics of the irregularly pruned weight matrices, such as the diverse redundancy of different rows, the sensitivity of different rows to pruning, and the positional characteristics of retained weights. By leveraging the gained insights as a guidance, we first propose the novel block-max weight masking (BMWM) method, which can effectively retain the salient weights while imposing high regularity to the weight matrix. As a further optimization, we propose a density-adaptive regular-block (DARB) pruning that outperforms prior structured pruning work with high pruning ratio and decoding efficiency. Our experimental results show that DARB can achieve 13$\times$ to 25$\times$ pruning ratio, which are 2.8$\times$ to 4.3$\times$ improvements than the state-of-the-art counterparts on multiple neural network models and tasks. Moreover, DARB can achieve 14.3$\times$ decoding efficiency than block pruning with higher pruning ratio. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1911.08020v2,Yes,potent(1)

The hallmark of the one-dimensional nature of ballistic nanowires is their quantized conductance. Here, we report the observation of conductance plateaus at multiples of the quantized value $2e^2/h$ in PbTe nanowires at finite magnetic fields. The quantized plateaus, as a function of source-drain bias and magnetic field, allow for the extraction of the Land\'e $g$-factor, sub-band spacing and effective mass. The coefficient of 2 in the plateau conductance indicates the presence of valley degeneracy arising from the crystal orientation of the nanowires, which are grown on a (001) substrate. Occasionally, this degeneracy can be lifted by a gate voltage that breaks the mirror symmetry.

In a specific scenario, we show that the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can be produced, and only the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy is allowed. The low-energy phenomena, including non-unitarity effects in neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless double-beta decays and rare lepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons l_alpha to l_beta + gamma, have been explored.

One effective solution is to increase the exposure to risky rare events while reweighting the probability measure. However, characterizing the distribution of risky events is particularly challenging due to the paucity of samples and the temporality of continuous scenario variables. To solve it, we devise a method to represent, generate, and reweight the distribution of risky rare events. We decompose the temporal evolution of continuous variables into distribution components based on conditional probability. By introducing the Risk Indicator Function, the distribution of risky rare events is theoretically precipitated out of naturalistic driving distribution. This targeted distribution is practically generated via Normalizing Flow, which achieves exact and tractable probability evaluation of intricate distribution. The rare event distribution is then demonstrated as the advantageous Importance Sampling distribution. We also promote the technique of temporal Importance Sampling. The combined method, named as TrimFlow, is executed to estimate the collision rate of Car-following scenarios as a tentative practice. The results showed that sampling background vehicle maneuvers from rare event distribution could evolve testing scenarios to hazardous states. TrimFlow reduced 86.1% of tests compared to generating testing scenarios according to their exposure in the naturalistic driving environment.

Recently, there has been a shift from the classical minimum free energy-based methods (MFE) to partition function-based ones that assemble structures using base-pairing probabilities. Two examples of the latter group are the popular maximum expected accuracy (MEA) method and the ProbKnot method. ProbKnot is a fast heuristic that pairs nucleotides that are reciprocally most probable pairing partners, and unlike MEA, can also predict structures with pseudoknots. However, ProbKnot's full potential has been largely overlooked. In particular, when introduced, it did not have an MEA-like hyperparameter that can balance between positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. We show that a simple thresholded version of ProbKnot, which we call ThreshKnot, leads to more accurate overall predictions by filtering out unlikely pairs whose probabilities fall under a given threshold. We also show that on three widely-used folding engines (RNAstructure, Vienna RNAfold, and CONTRAfold), ThreshKnot always outperforms the much more involved MEA algorithm in (1) its higher structure prediction accuracy, (2) its capability to predict pseudoknots, and (3) its faster runtime and easier implementation. This suggests that ThreshKnot should replace MEA as the default partition function-based structure prediction algorithm.

A new hydrodynamic model is thus derived and solved semi-analytically. The contribution of viscosity to critical acceleration amplitude is slight compared to other factors associated with dissipation, and the potential flow theory is sufficient to describe onset based on the present study, but the rotational component of velocity can change the timing of onset largely, which paradoxically comes from the viscosity. The model degenerates into a novel damped Mathieu equation if the viscosity is dropped with two damping terms referring to the gap-averaged damping and dissipation from dynamic contact angle, respectively. The former increases when the gap size decreases, and the latter grows as frequency rises. When it comes to the dispersion relation of Faraday waves, an unusual detuning emerges due to the imaginary part of the gap-averaged damping. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2402.05505v2,Yes,potent(1)

However, a common challenge existing text embedding models face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.

A much smaller ($\sim$3 magnitudes) brightening reached a maximum on UT 2011 August 30$\pm$1 (at 0.56 AU), and reflects the true break-up of the nucleus. This second peak was matched by a change in the morphology from centrally condensed to diffuse. The estimated cross-section of the nucleus when at 1 AU inbound was $\sim$1 km$^2$, corresponding to an equal-area circle of radius 0.6 km. No surviving fragments were found to a limiting red magnitude $r'$ = 24.4, corresponding to radii $\lesssim$40 m (red geometric albedo = 0.04 assumed). Our observations are consistent with disintegration of the nucleus into a power law size distribution of fragments with index $q$ = 3.3$\pm$0.2 combined with the action of radiation pressure. We speculate about physical processes that might cause nucleus disruption in a comet when still 0.7 AU from the Sun. Tidal stresses and devolatilization of the nucleus by sublimation are both negligible at this distance. However, the torque caused by mass loss, even at the very low rates measured in comet Elenin, is potentially large enough to be responsible by driving the nucleus to rotational instability.

This is true when the PDEs are obtained via parabolic scaling (undirected tissue), while no such patterns are observed for the PDEs arising by a hyperbolic limit (directed tissue).

At variance with other mechanisms such as charge noise, phonons are intrinsic to the device and can hardly be mitigated. They set, therefore fundamental limits to the relaxation time of the qubits. Here we introduce a general framework for the calculation of the spin (and charge) transition rates induced by bulk (3D) and strongly confined 1D or 2D phonons. We discuss the particular case of hole spin-orbit qubits described by the 6 bands kp model. We next apply this theory to a hole qubit in a silicon-on-insulator device. We show that spin relaxation in this device is dominated by a band mixing term that couples the holes to transverse acoustic phonons through the valence band deformation potential d, and optimize the bias point and magnetic field orientation to maximize the number of Rabi oscillations Q that can be achieved within on relaxation time T1. Despite the strong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band, the phonon-limited Q can reach a few tens of thousands. We next explore the effects of phonon confinement in 1D and 2D structures, and the impact of the encapsulation materials on the relaxation rates. We show that the spin lifetimes can depend on the structure of the device over micrometer-long length scales and that they improve when the materials around the qubit get harder. Phonon engineering in semiconductor qubits may therefore become relevant once the extrinsic sources of relaxation have been reduced.

Nevertheless, the predominantly manual approach of present-day inspections frequently results in inefficiencies and inadequate information management. Such methods often fall short of providing holistic, exhaustive assessments, consequently engendering regulatory oversights and potential safety hazards. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel framework named AutoRepo for automated generation of construction inspection reports. The unmanned vehicles efficiently perform construction inspections and collect scene information, while the multimodal large language models (LLMs) are leveraged to automatically generate the inspection reports. The framework was applied and tested on a real-world construction site, demonstrating its potential to expedite the inspection process, significantly reduce resource allocation, and produce high-quality, regulatory standard-compliant inspection reports. This research thus underscores the immense potential of multimodal large language models in revolutionizing construction inspection practices, signaling a significant leap forward towards a more efficient and safer construction management paradigm.

We present ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations of the Be$_2$ interatomic potential using the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The ground-state correlation energy is calculated by the trace formula with checks against the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem formula. We show that inclusion of GW corrections already improves the energy even at the level of the random-phase approximation. At the level of the BSE on top of the GW approximation, our calculation is in surprising agreement with the most accurate theories and with experiment. It even reproduces an experimentally observed flattening of the interatomic potential due to a delicate correlations balance from a competition between covalent and van der Waals bonding.

A single deep learning interatomic potential is able to describe the phase transitions between the amorphous, rhombohedral and cubic phases, with critical temperatures in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, this approach accurately captures the pronounced anharmonicity that is present in GeTe, enabling precise calculations of the thermal conductivity.

The images reveal an extensive population of co-moving boulders, the largest of which is about 7 m in diameter (geometric albedo 0.15 assumed). Measurements of 37 boulders show a mean sky-plane velocity dispersion of 0.30+/-0.03 m/s, only slightly larger than the 0.24 m/s gravitational escape velocity from the Didymos/Dimorphos binary system. The total boulder mass, 5e6 kg (density 2200 kg/m3 assumed), corresponds to about 0.1 percent of the mass of Dimorphos and the boulders collectively carry about 3e-5 of the kinetic energy delivered by the DART spacecraft impact. The sky-plane distribution of the boulders is asymmetric, consistent with impact into an inhomogeneous, likely rubble-pile, body. Surface boulder counts on Didymos show that the observed boulder swarm could be ejected from as little as 2 percent of the surface of Dimorphos (for example a circular crater at the impact point about 50 m in diameter).

Here we present a theoretical model to systematically investigate the influence of the active force, aspect ratio of NPs, particle size and membrane properties (adhesion energy density and membrane tension) on the cellular uptake of a nonspherical nanoparticle. It is found that the active force generated by an NP can trigger a type of first-order wrapping transition from a small partial wrapping state to a large one. In addition, the phase diagram in the force-aspect ratio (particle size, adhesion energy density and membrane tension) space displays more complex behaviors compared with that for the passive wrapping mediated merely by adhesion.

This paper aims to tackle a situation when precisely labeled samples are limited in the training set due to cost or availability constraints, whereas there could be an abundance of samples with imprecise labels. We focus on imprecise labels that are intervals, i.e., one can know that a sample belongs to an interval of labels but cannot know which unique label it has. This situation is quite common in health care datasets due to limitations of the diagnostic instrument, sparse clinical visits, or/and patient dropout. Limited research has been done to develop OL models with imprecise/interval labels. We propose a new Hybrid Ordinal Learner (HOL) to integrate samples with both precise and interval labels to train a robust OL model. We also develop a tractable and efficient optimization algorithm to solve the HOL formulation. We compare HOL with several recently developed OL methods on four benchmarking datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of HOL. Finally, we apply HOL to a real-world dataset for predicting the speed of progressing to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) based on a combination of multi-modality neuroimaging and demographic/clinical datasets. HOL achieves high accuracy in the prediction and outperforms existing methods.

Here we rely on the precise records of daily vehicle mobility based on GPS positioning device installed in taxis to uncover the potential daily predictability of urban traffic patterns. Using the mapping from the degree of congestion on roads into a time series of symbols and measuring its entropy, we find a relatively high daily predictability of traffic conditions despite the absence of any a priori knowledge of drivers' origins and destinations and quite different travel patterns between weekdays and weekends. Moreover, we find a counterintuitive dependence of the predictability on travel speed: the road segment associated with intermediate average travel speed is most difficult to be predicted. We also explore the possibility of recovering the traffic condition of an inaccessible segment from its adjacent segments with respect to limited observability. The highly predictable traffic patterns in spite of the heterogeneity of drivers' behaviors and the variability of their origins and destinations enables development of accurate predictive models for eventually devising practical strategies to mitigate urban road congestion.

We study the unusual renormalizations of the Fermi velocity $v_F$ and gap velocity $v_{\Delta}$ of these quasiparticles close to various quantum critical points in a superconducting dome. Special attention is paid to the behavior of the velocity ratio, $v_{\Delta}/v_F$, since it determines a number of observable quantities. We perform a renormalization-group analysis and show that the velocity ratio may vanish, approach unity, or diverge at different quantum critical points. The corresponding superfluid densities and critical temperatures are suppressed, slightly increased, or significantly enhanced. The effects of three types of static disorders, namely, random mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, on the stability of the system are also addressed. An analogous analysis reveals that both random mass and random gauge potential are irrelevant. This implies that these fixed points of the velocity ratio are stable, and hence observable effects ignited by them are unchanged. However, the random chemical potential is marginal. As a result, these fixed points are broken, and thus, the instabilities of quantum phase transitions are triggered. ",https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.054511,1302.6137v1,Yes,potent(4)

This non-Fermi liquid state may be turned into a disorder-dominated diffusive metal if the fermions also couple to a disordered potential that generates a relevant perturbation in the sense of renormalization group theory. It is therefore necessary to examine whether a specific disorder is relevant or not. We study the interplay between critical nematic fluctuation and random chemical potential by performing renormalization group analysis. The parameter that characterizes the strength of random chemical potential is marginal at the one-loop level, but becomes marginally relevant after including the two-loop corrections. Thus even weak random chemical potential leads to diffusive motion of nodal fermions and the significantly critical behaviors of physical implications, since the strength flows eventually to large values at low energies.

The resulted gravitational scalar radiation field obtains a scalar-energy-density-dependent effective mass, arising from a gravitational scalar potential that consists of a monotonically decreasing self-interactions of gravitational scalar field and an increasing exponential coupling between the scalar field and the NS/WD matter. Owing to a thin-ring-orbit effect, the gravitational interactions encoded by the massive scalar field is screened in the region of binary orbit, with high density of stars' scalar energy, which gives us the estimation for scalar masses of about $10^{-21} eV/c^2$ and leads to a Yulkawa-like correction to the Newtonian potential of the binary system.

The two scalarized NSs dip in a Higgs-like gravitational scalar potential, where the massless scalar background fluctuation field plays the role of Higgs field. Consequently, the gravitational scalar background field becomes massive. The radiated gravitons, propagating in a Yukawa-corrected potential, acquire a scalar-background-dependent mass term, in a massive-scalar-field-mediated way. We demonstrate that the mass of gravitons depends on intrinsic properties of the sources, which is not a certain value. The background-dependent masses for gravitons from scalarized orbital shrinking DNS is variable with the compactness of two components, as well as the separation of the binary.

Based on Dewitt's approach, we calculate the gravitational Casimir energy cost of the binary plane, which consists of statically gravitational effects and deformation-induced effects. It is found that the static effects include a term coming from the self-gravity of the orbital plane and the contribution of Newtonian gravitational potential of the binary system. While the deformation-induced effect also results from two parts, i.e. the instability of orbital binding energy, scaling as $\frac{1}{(R-r)^2}$, and the dynamically Casimir energy cost of the orbital binding energy, decaying as $\frac{1}{(R-r)^4}$. The dynamically gravitational Casimir phenomena and the corresponding energy cost modify the spiral-in orbital motion of the binary and thus the frequency of released gravitational waves (GWs). We consider the mechanical response of two NS components and qualitatively study the corrections to the orbital motion of the system and the GW frequencies. It is found that the dynamical Casimir effects exert a dissipative force on the binary plane, depending on the frequency of GWs. The resultant dissipation may enhance with the decaying separation and increasing GW frequencies, which subsequently accelerates the orbital decay of the binary. However, the dissipation rate just has an order of $10^{-70}$ eV/s. So the corrections to the dynamics of NS binaries are very marginal, by considering the wide separation, the cosmological coalescence time, and low-frequency GWs of the system.

A comparative study of the state-of-the-art QKD technologies is carried out, including both terrestrial QKD via optical fibers and free-space optics, as well as spaceborne solutions via satellites. We compare the pros and cons of various existing QKD technologies, including channel loss, potential interference, distance, connection topology, deployment cost and requirements, as well as application scenarios. Technical selection criteria and deployment requirements are developed for various different QKD solutions in each segment of networks. For example, optical fiber-based QKD is suitable for access networks due to its limited distance and compatibility with point-to-multipoint (P2MP) topology; with the help of trusted relays, it can be extended to long-haul and metro networks. Spaceborne QKD on the other hand, has much smaller channel loss and extended transmission distance, which can be used for transoceanic and long-haul networks exploiting satellite-based trusted relays.

This paper presents a basic machine learning algorithm, named Dendrite Net or DD, just like Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). DD's main concept is that the algorithm can recognize this class after learning, if the output's logical expression contains the corresponding class's logical relationship among inputs (and$\backslash$or$\backslash$not). Experiments and main results: DD, a white-box machine learning algorithm, showed excellent system identification performance for the black-box system. Secondly, it was verified by nine real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability relative to MLP architecture that imitated neurons' cell body (Cell body Net) for regression. Thirdly, by MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets, it was verified that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than Cell body Net for classification. The number of modules can effectively adjust DD's logical expression capacity, which avoids over-fitting and makes it easy to get a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated experiments in MATLAB and PyTorch (Python) demonstrated that DD was faster than Cell body Net both in epoch and forward-propagation. The main contribution of this paper is the basic machine learning algorithm (DD) with a white-box attribute, controllable precision for better generalization capability, and lower computational complexity. Not only can DD be used for generalized engineering, but DD has vast development potential as a module for deep learning.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a versatile tool for image segmentation without specific domain training, but it requires human prompts and may have limitations in specific domains. Traditional models like nnUNet perform automatic segmentation during inference and are effective in specific domains but need extensive domain-specific training. To combine the strengths of foundational and domain-specific models, we propose nnSAM, integrating SAM's robust feature extraction with nnUNet's automatic configuration to enhance segmentation accuracy on small datasets. Our nnSAM model optimizes two main approaches: leveraging SAM's feature extraction and nnUNet's domain-specific adaptation, and incorporating a boundary shape supervision loss function based on level set functions and curvature calculations to learn anatomical shape priors from limited data. We evaluated nnSAM on four segmentation tasks: brain white matter, liver, lung, and heart segmentation. Our method outperformed others, achieving the highest DICE score of 82.77% and the lowest ASD of 1.14 mm in brain white matter segmentation with 20 training samples, compared to nnUNet's DICE score of 79.25% and ASD of 1.36 mm. A sample size study highlighted nnSAM's advantage with fewer training samples. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance with nnSAM, showcasing its potential for small-sample learning in medical image segmentation.

We additionally introduce a distributed prototype supervision method and complementary correlation matching module to guide the model in digging precise semantic relations among support and query images.

Here we present band engineering in the twisted orbital-active bilayers with spin-orbit coupling. The symmetry constraints on the interlayer coupling that determines the effective potential for low-energy physics of moir\'e electrons are exhaustively derived for two-dimensional point groups. We find the line graph or biparticle sublattice of moir\'e pattern emerge with a minimal $C_3$ symmetry, which exhibit isolated electronic flat bands with nontrivial topology. The band flatness is insensitive to the twist angle since they come from the interference effect. Armed with this guiding principle, we predict that twisted bilayers of 2H-PbS$_2$ and CdS realize the salient physics to engineer two-dimensional topological quantum phases. At small twist angles, PbS$_2$ heterostructures give rise to an emergent moir\'e Kagom\'e lattice, while CdS heterostructures lead to an emergent moir\'e honeycomb lattice, and both of them host moir\'e quantum spin Hall insulators with almost flat topological bands. We further study superconductivity of these two systems with local attractive interactions. The superfluid weight and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are determined by multiband processes and quantum geometry of the band in the flat-band limit when the pairing potential exceeds the band width. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayers with multi-orbitals as a promising tunable platform to realize correlated topological phases. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2209.06524v1,Yes,potent(2)

In order to determine a small set of proposals with a high recall, a common scheme is extracting multiple features followed by a ranking algorithm which however, incurs two major challenges: {\bf 1)} The ranking model often imposes pairwise constraints between each proposal, rendering the problem away from an efficient training/testing phase; {\bf 2)} Linear kernels are utilized due to the computational and memory bottleneck of training a kernelized model.   In this paper, we remedy these two issues by suggesting a {\em kernelized partial ranking model}. In particular, we demonstrate that {\bf i)} our partial ranking model reduces the number of constraints from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nk)$ where $n$ is the number of all potential proposals for an image but we are only interested in top-$k$ of them that has the largest overlap with the ground truth; {\bf ii)} we permit non-linear kernels in our model which is often superior to the linear classifier in terms of accuracy. For the sake of mitigating the computational and memory issues, we introduce a consistent weighted sampling~(CWS) paradigm that approximates the non-linear kernel as well as facilitates an efficient learning. In fact, as we will show, training a linear CWS model amounts to learning a kernelized model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that equipped with the non-linear kernel and the partial ranking algorithm, recall at top-$k$ proposals can be substantially improved.

Computing and comparing susceptibilities of twelve potential candidates indicates that charge density wave always dominates over all other instabilities. Incidently, there exist several subleading ones including the $x$-current, bond density, and chiral plus s-wave superconductors.

This flow phenomenon is considered to be highly detrimental during flight and poses a significant risk to the structural strength and fatigue life of aircraft. Up to now, there has been a lack of an accurate, efficient, and intuitive metric to predict buffet and impose a feasible constraint on aerodynamic design. In this paper, a Physics-Assisted Variational Autoencoder (PAVAE) is proposed to identify dominant features of transonic buffet, which combines unsupervised reduced-order modeling with additional physical information embedded via a buffet classifier. Specifically, four models with various weights adjusting the contribution of the classifier are trained, so as to investigate the impact of buffet information on the latent space. Statistical results reveal that buffet state can be determined exactly with just one latent space when a proper weight of classifier is chosen. The dominant latent space further reveals a strong relevance with the key flow features located in the boundary layers downstream of shock. Based on this identification, the displacement thickness at 80% chordwise location is proposed as a metric for buffet prediction. This metric achieves an accuracy of 98.5% in buffet state classification, which is more reliable than the existing separation metric used in design. The proposed method integrates the benefits of feature extraction, flow reconstruction, and buffet prediction into a unified framework, demonstrating its potential in low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data and interpreting the ""black box"" neural network.

Decoding the low-energy information from these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of nodal-line superconductors.

We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions.

Such fixed points principally dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime, which are always associated with some instabilities with specific symmetry breakings and thus accompanied by certain phase transitions. In order to judge the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we bring out a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, it is determined that the dominant states correspond to a spin-singlet superconductivity, a spin-triplet pair-density-wave, and a spin-triplet superconductivity for approaching the fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively.

Near the quantum critical point, the coupling between gapless nodal quasiparticles and nematic order parameter fluctuation can result in unusual behaviors, such as extreme anisotropy of fermion velocities. We study the disorder effect on the nematic quantum critical behavior and especially on the flow of fermion velocities. The disorders that couple to nodal quasiparticles are divided into three types: random mass, random gauge field, and random chemical potential. A renormalization group analysis shows that random mass and random gauge field are both irrelevant and thus do not change the fixed point of extreme velocity anisotropy. However, the marginal interaction due to random chemical potential destroys this fixed point and makes the nematic phase transition unstable.

Low frequency optical absorption due to the surface state is universally determined by the fine structure constant. When the thickness of these three dimensional topological insulators is reduced, they become quasi-two dimensional insulators with enhanced absorbance. The two dimensional insulators can be topologically trivial or non-trivial depending on the thickness, and we predict that the optical absorption is larger for topological non-trivial case compared with the trivial case. Since the three dimensional topological insulator surface state is intrinsically gapless, we propose its potential application in wide bandwidth, high performance photo-detection covering a broad spectrum ranging from terahertz to infrared. The performance of photodetection can be dramatically enhanced when the thickness is reduced to several quintuple layers, with a widely tunable band gap depending on the thickness.

At zero chemical potential, the longitudinal and transverse components of gauge interaction are both long-ranged. There is no fermion velocity renormalization since the system respects Lorentz invariance. At finite chemical potential, the Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken by the finite Fermi surface. The longitudinal gauge interaction is statically screened and becomes unimportant, whereas the transverse gauge interaction remains long-ranged and leads to singular renormalization of fermion velocity. The anomalous dimension of fermion velocity is calculated by means of the renormalization group method. We then examine the influence of singular velocity renormalization on several physical quantities, and show that they exhibit different behavior at zero and finite chemical potential.

In previously presented photonic neural networks, architectures are mainly designed for fully-connected layers. When convolutional layers are executed in such neural networks, the large-scale electrooptic modulation array heavily increases the energy dissipation on chip. To increase the energy efficiency, here we show an integrated photonic architecture specifically for convolutional layer calculations. Optical delay lines replace electronics to execute data manipulations on optical chip, reducing the scale of electro-optic modulation array. Consequently, the energy dissipation of these parts is mitigated. Powered by wavelength division multiplexing, the footprint of delay lines is significantly reduced compared with previous art, thus being practical to fabricate. We evaluate the potential performance of the proposed architecture with respect to component flaws in practical fabrications. According to the results, with well-controlled system insertion loss, energy efficiency of the proposed architecture would surpass previously presented works and the state-of-art electronic processors.

We further study the edge transport in this system by Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism, and find such gapless edge state is dissipative and not immune to backscattering, which would explain the dissipative nonlocal transport in the axion insulator state observed in six septuple layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ experimentally.

Performing the standard renormalization group analysis shows that the Cooper theorem is violated at zero chemical potential but instead Cooper instability can be generated only if the absolute strength of fermion-fermion coupling exceeds certain critical value and transfer momentum is restricted to a confined region, which is determined by the initial conditions. Rather, the Cooper theorem would be instantly restored once a finite chemical potential is introduced and thus a chemical potential-tuned phase transition is expected. Additionally, we briefly examine the effects of impurity scatterings on the Cooper instability at zero chemical potential, which in principle are harmful to Cooper instability although they can enhance the density of states of systems.

With proper variations of these two kinds of parameters, the tilted Dirac fermions can either flow towards the Gaussian fixed point or undergo certain instability that is conventionally accompanied by a phase transition in the low-energy regime.

However, current methods treat logo embedding as a purely visual problem, which may limit their performance in real-world scenarios. A notable issue is that the textual knowledge embedded in logo images has not been adequately explored. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that leverages textual knowledge as an auxiliary to improve the robustness of logo embedding. The emerging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both visual and textual understanding and could become valuable visual assistants in understanding logo images. Inspired by this observation, our proposed method, FashionLOGO, aims to utilize MLLMs to enhance fashion logo embedding. We explore how MLLMs can improve logo embedding by prompting them to generate explicit textual knowledge through three types of prompts, including image OCR, brief captions, and detailed descriptions prompts, in a zero-shot setting. We adopt a cross-attention transformer to enable image embedding queries to learn supplementary knowledge from textual embeddings automatically. To reduce computational costs, we only use the image embedding model in the inference stage, similar to traditional inference pipelines. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FashionLOGO learns generalized and robust logo embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all benchmark datasets.

With the application of renormalization group, several interesting low-energy behaviors are extracted from the coupled equations of all interaction parameters. At the clean limit, fermion-fermion interactions decrease with lowering the energy scales but conversely fermion velocities climb up and approach certain saturated values. This yields a slight decrease or increase of the anisotropy of fermion velocities depending upon their initial ratio. After bringing out four kinds of disorders designated by the random charge ($\Delta_{1}$), random mass ($\Delta_{2}$), random axial chemical potential ($\Delta_{3}$), and spin-orbit scatterers ($\Delta_{4}$) based on their own unique features, we begin with presenting the distinct low-energy fates of these disorders. For the presence of sole disorder, its strength becomes either relevant ($\Delta_{1,4}$) or irrelevant($\Delta_{2,3}$) in the low-energy regime. However, the competition for multiple sorts of disorders is capable of qualitatively reshaping the low-energy properties of disorders $\Delta_{2,3,4}$. Besides, it can generate an initially absent disorder as long as two of $\Delta_{1,2,3}$ are present. In addition, the fermion-fermion couplings are insensitive to the presence of $\Delta_4$ but rather substantially modified by $\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$, or $\Delta_3$, and evolve towards zero or certain finite non-zero values under the coexistence of distinct disorders. Furthermore, the fermion velocities flow towards certain finite saturated value for the only presence of $\Delta_{2,3}$ and vanish for all other situations. As to their ratio, it acquires a little increase once the disorder is subordinate to fermionic interactions, otherwise keeps some fixed constant. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2212.02356v3,Yes,potent(1)

An economic challenge arises in the presence of strategic agents' private information. Existing studies proposed (economic) mechanisms but largely neglected the issue of large-scale implementation. Specifically, they require certain modifications to the deployed algorithms, which may bring the significant cost.

The Large-Scale VCG Mechanism maximizes the network utility and achieves individual rationality and budget balance. With infinitely many agents, agents' truthful reports of their types are their dominant strategies; for the finite case, each agent's incentive to misreport converges quadratically to zero. For practical implementation, we introduce a modified mechanism that possesses an additional important technical property, superimposability, which makes it able to be built upon any (potentially distributed) algorithm that optimally solves the NUM Problem and ensures all agents to obey the algorithm. We then extend this idea to the dynamic case, when agents' types are dynamically evolving as a controlled Markov process.

However, classical frameworks of privacy (e.g., differential privacy (DP)) have overlooked the impact of data freshness on privacy guarantees, which may lead to unnecessary accuracy loss when trying to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees in time-varying databases. In this work, we introduce \textit{age-dependent DP}, taking into account the underlying stochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we establish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP, based on which we characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on privacy guarantees. Our characterization demonstrates that \textit{aging}, i.e., using stale data inputs and/or postponing the release of outputs, can be a new strategy to protect data privacy in addition to noise injection in the traditional DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a multi-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for age-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize the optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be achieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve a target of an arbitrarily small privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection only leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as in the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.

To address this challenge, we have developed a strategy that involves the superposition of PEPS with open boundary conditions (OBC) to treat systems with PBC. This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of such systems while maintaining their translational invariance and the PBC. We benchmark this method against the Heisenberg model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ model, demonstrating its capability to yield highly accurate results at low computational costs, even for large system sizes.

However, from a mobile network operator's (MNO's) viewpoint, it can either reduce revenue or increase congestion, and thus has been blocked by some MNOs in practice. We propose a hybrid pricing framework for MNOs who charge users separately for access and tethering. This scheme serves to coordinate the tethering decisions of mobile users with MNO network management objectives. We analyze the MNOs' equilibrium pricing strategies in both cooperative and competitive scenarios. In the cooperative scenario, at the equilibrium, each user's cost is independent of any chosen tethering links. We then characterize the optimal hybrid pricing strategies of MNOs in this scenario. For the competitive scenario, we formulate the MNOs' competitive interactions as a pricing game, and we show that MNO competition leads to equalized prices for users if an equilibrium exists but does not guarantee its existence. Both insights motivate a quantity competition game, which is shown to guarantee an equilibrium. Simulation results show that in scenarios of interest the proposed hybrid pricing schemes can double both MNOs' profit and users' payoff and such improvements increase with the degree of network heterogeneity.

The source charges the destination for each update and designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its profit; the destination on the other hand chooses a data update schedule to minimize the summation of its payments to the source and its age-related cost. The interaction among the source and destination is hence game-theoretic. Motivated by the existing pricing literature, we first study a time-dependent pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested. We show in this case that the game equilibrium leads to only one data update, which does not yield the maximum profit to the source. This motivates us to consider a quantity-based pricing scheme, in which the price of each update depends on how many updates have been previously requested. We show that among all pricing schemes in which the price of an update may vary according to both time and quantity, the quantity-based pricing scheme performs best: it maximizes the source's profit and minimizes the social cost of the system, defined as the aggregate source's operational cost and the destination's age-related cost. Numerical results show that the optimal quantity-based pricing can be 27% more profitable for the source and incurs 54% less social cost, compared with the optimal time-dependent pricing.

When strategic data sources have private market information, a fundamental economic challenge is how to incentivize them to acquire fresh data and optimize the age-related performance. In this work, we consider an information update system in which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from multiple sources. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the AoI. Each source is strategic and incurs a sampling cost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to the destination. The destination decides on the price of updates, when to get them, and who should generate them, based on the sources' reported sampling costs. We show that a benchmark that naively trusts the sources' reports can lead to an arbitrarily bad outcome compared to the case where sources truthfully report. To tackle this issue, we design an optimal (economic) mechanism for timely information acquisition following Myerson's seminal work. To this end, our proposed optimal mechanism minimizes the sum of the destination's age-related cost and its payment to the sources, while ensuring that the sources truthfully report their private information and will voluntarily participate in the mechanism. However, finding the optimal mechanisms may suffer from \textit{prohibitively expensive computational overheads} as it involves solving a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization problem. We further propose a quantized version of the optimal mechanism that achieves asymptotic optimality, maintains the other economic properties, and enables one to tradeoff between optimality and computational overheads.

0000-0002-1743-0686,Meng Zhang,"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology Gene technology",Pricing Fresh Data,1970,"  We introduce the concept of {\it fresh data trading}, in which a destination user requests, and pays for, fresh data updates from a source provider, and data freshness is captured by the {\it age of information} (AoI) metric. Keeping data fresh relies on frequent data updates by the source, which motivates the source to {\it price fresh data}. In this work, the destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the AoI. The source designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its profit; the destination chooses a data update schedule to trade off its payments to the source and its age-related cost. Depending on different real-time applications and scenarios, we study both a predictable-deadline and an unpredictable-deadline models. The key challenge of designing the optimal pricing scheme lies in the destination's time-interdependent valuations, due to the nature of AoI and the infinite-dimensional and dynamic optimization. To this end, we consider three pricing schemes that exploit and understand the profitability of three different dimensions in designing pricing: a {\it time-dependent} pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested; a {\it quantity-based} pricing scheme, in which the price of each update depends on how many updates have been previously requested; a {\it subscription-based} pricing scheme, in which the price for each update is flat-rate but the source charges an additional subscription fee. Our analysis reveals that the optimal subscription-based pricing maximizes the source's profit among all possible pricing schemes under both predictable deadline and unpredictable deadline models; the optimal quantity-based pricing scheme is only optimal with a predictable deadline; the time-dependent pricing scheme, under the unpredictable deadline, is asymptotically optimal under significant time discounting.

In this paper, we introduce RelicVR, a virtual reality (VR) game that encourages players to discover artifacts through physical interaction in a game-based approach. Players need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure by using available tools and physical movements. The game relies on the dynamic voxel deformation technique to allow players to chip away earth covering the artifacts. We added uncertainty in the exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological discovery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features of the hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually but strategically without hitting the artifact itself. From playtesting sessions with eight participants, we found that the uncertainty elements are conducive to their engagement and exploration experience.

Owing to the intricate microscopic representation of EoE in imaging, current methodologies which depend on manual identification are not only labor-intensive but also prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we develop an open-source toolkit, named Open-EoE, to perform end-to-end whole slide image (WSI) level eosinophil (Eos) detection using one line of command via Docker.

The current description and quantification of features on pathology slides are limited, prompting the need for innovative solutions to comprehensively assess diverse phenotypic attributes within Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In particular, understanding the morphological characteristics of podocytes, terminally differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, is crucial for studying glomerular injury. This paper introduces the Spatial Pathomics Toolkit (SPT) and applies it to podocyte pathomics. The SPT consists of three main components: (1) instance object segmentation, enabling precise identification of podocyte nuclei; (2) pathomics feature generation, extracting a comprehensive array of quantitative features from the identified nuclei; and (3) robust statistical analyses, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of spatial relationships between morphological and spatial transcriptomics features.The SPT successfully extracted and analyzed morphological and textural features from podocyte nuclei, revealing a multitude of podocyte morphomic features through statistical analysis. Additionally, we demonstrated the SPT's ability to unravel spatial information inherent to podocyte distribution, shedding light on spatial patterns associated with glomerular injury.

For example, in genetic studies, multiple genomic data sets at different molecular levels or from different cell types are measured for a common set of individuals to investigate genetic regulation. Integration and reduction of multi-view data have the potential to leverage information in different data sets, and to reduce the magnitude and complexity of data for further statistical analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical model, called supervised integrated factor analysis (SIFA), for integrative dimension reduction of multi-view data while incorporating auxiliary covariates. The model decomposes data into joint and individual factors, capturing the joint variation across multiple data sets and the individual variation specific to each set respectively. Moreover, both joint and individual factors are partially informed by auxiliary covariates via nonparametric models. We devise a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model under some identifiability conditions. We apply the method to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data, and provide new insights into the variation decomposition of gene expression in multiple tissues.

A quantitative description of RIP involves bounding the so-called RIP constants of measurement matrices. In this respect, it is noteworthy that most results in the literature concerning RIP are upper bounds of RIP constants, which can be interpreted as a theoretical guarantee of successful sparse recovery. On the contrary, the land of lower bounds for RIP constants remains uncultivated. Lower bounds of RIP constants, if exist, can be interpreted as the fundamental limit aspect of successful sparse recovery. In this paper, the lower bound of RIP constants Gaussian random matrices are derived, along with a guide for generalization to sub-Gaussian random matrices. This provides a new proof of the fundamental limit that the minimal number of measurements needed to enforce the RIP of order $s$ is $\Omega(s\log({\rm e}N/s))$, which is more straight-forward than the classical Gelfand width argument. Furthermore, in the proof, we propose a useful technical tool featuring the concentration phenomenon for top-$k$ sum of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, which is closely related to mainstream problems in statistics and is of independent interest.

While their practical power has now been widely recognized, the theoretical underpinnings remain far from mature. In this work, we develop a suite of non-asymptotic theory towards understanding the data generation process of diffusion models in discrete time, assuming access to $\ell_2$-accurate estimates of the (Stein) score functions. For a popular deterministic sampler (based on the probability flow ODE), we establish a convergence rate proportional to $1/T$ (with $T$ the total number of steps), improving upon past results; for another mainstream stochastic sampler (i.e., a type of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model), we derive a convergence rate proportional to $1/\sqrt{T}$, matching the state-of-the-art theory. Imposing only minimal assumptions on the target data distribution (e.g., no smoothness assumption is imposed), our results characterize how $\ell_2$ score estimation errors affect the quality of the data generation processes. In contrast to prior works, our theory is developed based on an elementary yet versatile non-asymptotic approach without resorting to toolboxes for SDEs and ODEs. Further, we design two accelerated variants, improving the convergence to $1/T^2$ for the ODE-based sampler and $1/T$ for the DDPM-type sampler, which might be of independent theoretical and empirical interest.

When it comes to a finite-horizon episodic Markov decision process with $S$ states, $A$ actions and horizon length $H$, substantial progress has been achieved towards characterizing the minimax-optimal regret, which scales on the order of $\sqrt{H^2SAT}$ (modulo log factors) with $T$ the total number of samples. While several competing solution paradigms have been proposed to minimize regret, they are either memory-inefficient, or fall short of optimality unless the sample size exceeds an enormous threshold (e.g., $S^6A^4 \,\mathrm{poly}(H)$ for existing model-free methods).   To overcome such a large sample size barrier to efficient RL, we design a novel model-free algorithm, with space complexity $O(SAH)$, that achieves near-optimal regret as soon as the sample size exceeds the order of $SA\,\mathrm{poly}(H)$. In terms of this sample size requirement (also referred to the initial burn-in cost), our method improves -- by at least a factor of $S^5A^3$ -- upon any prior memory-efficient algorithm that is asymptotically regret-optimal. Leveraging the recently introduced variance reduction strategy (also called {\em reference-advantage decomposition}), the proposed algorithm employs an {\em early-settled} reference update rule, with the aid of two Q-learning sequences with upper and lower confidence bounds. The design principle of our early-settled variance reduction method might be of independent interest to other RL settings that involve intricate exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Visible watermark removal aims to eliminate the interference of watermarks and restore the background content. However, existing methods often implement watermark component removal and background restoration tasks within a singular branch, leading to residual watermarks in the predictions and ignoring cases where watermarks heavily obscure the background. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Removing Interference and Recovering Content Imaginatively (RIRCI) framework. RIRCI embodies a two-stage approach: the initial phase centers on discerning and segregating the watermark component, while the subsequent phase focuses on background content restoration. To achieve meticulous background restoration, our proposed model employs a dual-path network capable of fully exploring the intrinsic background information beneath semi-transparent watermarks and peripheral contextual information from unaffected regions. Moreover, a Global and Local Context Interaction module is built upon multi-layer perceptrons and bidirectional feature transformation for comprehensive representation modeling in the background restoration phase. The efficacy of our approach is empirically validated across two large-scale datasets, and our findings reveal a marked enhancement over existing watermark removal techniques.

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework.

The current paper pertains to a scenario with value-based linear representation, which postulates the linear realizability of the optimal Q-function (also called the ""linear $Q^{\star}$ problem""). While linear realizability alone does not allow for sample-efficient solutions in general, the presence of a large sub-optimality gap is a potential game changer, depending on the sampling mechanism in use. Informally, sample efficiency is achievable with a large sub-optimality gap when a generative model is available but is unfortunately infeasible when we turn to standard online RL settings.   In this paper, we make progress towards understanding this linear $Q^{\star}$ problem by investigating a new sampling protocol, which draws samples in an online/exploratory fashion but allows one to backtrack and revisit previous states in a controlled and infrequent manner. This protocol is more flexible than the standard online RL setting, while being practically relevant and far more restrictive than the generative model. We develop an algorithm tailored to this setting, achieving a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the feature dimension, the horizon, and the inverse sub-optimality gap, but not the size of the state/action space.

In this paper, we present a streamlined affordance learning system that encompasses data collection, effective model training, and robot deployment. First, we collect training data from egocentric videos in an automatic manner. Different from previous methods that focus only on the object graspable affordance and represent it as coarse heatmaps, we cover both graspable (e.g., object handles) and functional affordances (e.g., knife blades, hammer heads) and extract data with precise segmentation masks.

It is hypothesized that stressful early life experience of very preterm neonate is imprinting gut microbiome by the regulation of the so-called brain-gut axis, and consequently, certain microbiome markers are predictive of later infant neurodevelopment. To investigate, a preterm infant study was conducted; infant fecal samples were collected during the infants' first month of postnatal age, resulting in functional compositional microbiome data, and neurobehavioral outcomes were measured when infants reached 36-38 weeks of post-menstrual age. To identify potential microbiome markers and estimate how the trajectories of gut microbiome compositions during early postnatal stage impact later neurobehavioral outcomes of the preterm infants, we innovate a sparse log-contrast regression with functional compositional predictors. The functional simplex structure is strictly preserved, and the functional compositional predictors are allowed to have sparse, smoothly varying, and accumulating effects on the outcome through time. Through a pragmatic basis expansion step, the problem boils down to a linearly constrained sparse group regression, for which we develop an efficient algorithm and obtain theoretical performance guarantees.

0009-0000-2151-595X,Gen Li,"KU Leuven, KU Leuven Association",Boosting current-induced molecular dynamics with machine-learning   potential,1970,"  In a current-carrying single-molecular junction (SMJ), a hierarchy of hybrid energy transport processes takes place under a highly nonequilibrium situation, including energy transfer from electrons to molecular vibrations via electron-vibration interaction, energy redistribution within different vibrational modes via anharmonic coupling, and eventual energy transport to surrounding electrodes. A comprehensive understanding of such processes is a prerequisite for their potential applications as single-molecular devices. $Ab$ $initio$ current-induced molecular dynamics (MD) is an ideal approach to address this complicated problem. But the computational cost hinders its usage in systematic study of realistic SMJs. Here, we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in the speed of MD simulation by employing machine-learning potential with accuracy comparable to density functional theory. Using this approach, we show that SMJs with graphene electrodes generate order of magnitude less heating than those with gold electrodes. Our work illustrates the superior heat transport property of graphene as electrodes for SMJs, thanks to its better phonon spectral overlap with molecular vibrations.

0009-0000-2151-595X,Gen Li,"KU Leuven, KU Leuven Association",An Empirical Bayes Approach for Multiple Tissue eQTL Analysis,1970,"  Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, which identify genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene, are an important tool in the understanding of diseases in human and other populations. While most eQTL studies to date consider the connection between genetic variation and expression in a single tissue, complex, multi-tissue data sets are now being generated by the GTEx initiative. These data sets have the potential to improve the findings of single tissue analyses by borrowing strength across tissues, and the potential to elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between tissues.   In this paper we introduce and study a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian model (MT-eQTL) for multi-tissue eQTL analysis. MT-eQTL directly models the vector of correlations between expression and genotype across tissues. It explicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTLs, as well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. Moreover, the model is applicable to complex designs in which the set of donors can (i) vary from tissue to tissue, and (ii) exhibit incomplete overlap between tissues. The MT-eQTL model is marginally consistent, in the sense that the model for a subset of tissues can be obtained from the full model via marginalization. Fitting of the MT-eQTL model is carried out via empirical Bayes, using an approximate EM algorithm. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the configuration of eQTLs across tissues are derived from adaptive thresholding of local false discovery rates, and maximum a-posteriori estimation, respectively. We investigate the MT-eQTL model through a simulation study, and rigorously establish the FDR control of the local FDR testing procedure under mild assumptions appropriate for dependent data.

0009-0000-2151-595X,Gen Li,"KU Leuven, KU Leuven Association",Dynamic Sparsity Is Channel-Level Sparsity Learner,1970,"  Sparse training has received an upsurging interest in machine learning due to its tantalizing saving potential for the entire training process as well as inference. Dynamic sparse training (DST), as a leading sparse training approach, can train deep neural networks at high sparsity from scratch to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most if not all DST prior arts demonstrate their effectiveness on unstructured sparsity with highly irregular sparse patterns, which receives limited support in common hardware. This limitation hinders the usage of DST in practice. In this paper, we propose Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase), which for the first time seamlessly translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly channel-level sparsity (not fine-grained N:M or group sparsity) during one end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations. The resulting small sparse networks can be directly accelerated by commodity hardware, without using any particularly sparsity-aware hardware accelerators. This appealing outcome is partially motivated by a hidden phenomenon of dynamic sparsity: off-the-shelf unstructured DST implicitly involves biased parameter reallocation across channels, with a large fraction of channels (up to 60%) being sparser than others. By progressively identifying and removing these channels during training, our approach translates unstructured sparsity to channel-wise sparsity. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chase achieves 1.7 X inference throughput speedup on common GPU devices without compromising accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

Calibration error (CE) is an indicator of the alignment between the predicted probabilities and the classifier accuracy. While prior works have delved into the implications of dataset shift on calibration, existing CE estimators assume access to labels from the target domain, which are often unavailable in practice, i.e., when the model is deployed and used. This work addresses such challenging scenario, and proposes a novel CE estimator under label shift, which is characterized by changes in the marginal label distribution $p(Y)$, while keeping the conditional $p(X|Y)$ constant between the source and target distributions. Our contribution is an approach, which, by leveraging importance re-weighting of the labeled source distribution, provides consistent and asymptotically unbiased CE estimation with respect to the shifted target distribution. Empirical results across diverse real-world datasets, under various conditions and label-shift intensities, demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed estimator.

Punctuation is a diversion, however, since human language processing does not rely on punctuation to the same extent, and in informal texts, we therefore often leave out punctuation. We also use punctuation ungrammatically for emphatic or creative purposes, or simply by mistake. We show that (a) dependency parsers are sensitive to both absence of punctuation and to alternative uses; (b) neural parsers tend to be more sensitive than vintage parsers; (c) training neural parsers without punctuation outperforms all out-of-the-box parsers across all scenarios where punctuation departs from standard punctuation. Our main experiments are on synthetically corrupted data to study the effect of punctuation in isolation and avoid potential confounds, but we also show effects on out-of-domain data.

In this work, we compare two methods to embed datasets in a transformer-based multilingual dependency parser, and perform an extensive evaluation. We show that: 1) embedding the dataset is still beneficial with these models 2) performance increases are highest when embedding the dataset at the encoder level 3) unsurprisingly, we confirm that performance increases are highest for small datasets and datasets with a low baseline score. 4) we show that training on the combination of all datasets performs similarly to designing smaller clusters based on language-relatedness.

Many believe that cross-frequency coupling between the amplitude of high frequency local field potential oscillations in one region and the phase of lower frequency signals in another may form a possible mechanism. This work provides a preliminary study from both an experimental and theoretical viewpoint, concentrating on possible coupling between the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex in rats during tasks involving working memory, spatial navigation and decision making processes. Attempts to search for such coupling events are made using newly developed MATLAB scripts. This leads to the discovery of increased envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC) between the 1-10 Hz hippocampus theta and 30-40 Hz pre-fontal cortex gamma bands when a choice turn is approached during a T-maze task. From a theoretical perspective, a standard connectionist modelling approach is extended to allow for the formation of oscillations. Although detrimental to overall average task performance, this did lead to a reduced increase in performance variation as noise was increased, when compared to a standard non-oscillating model.

Most document-level NMT systems rely on meticulously curated sentence-level parallel data, assuming flawless extraction of text from documents along with their precise reading order. These systems also tend to disregard additional visual cues such as the document layout, deeming it irrelevant. However, real-world documents often possess intricate text layouts that defy these assumptions. Extracting information from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or heuristic rules can result in errors, and the layout (e.g., paragraphs, headers) may convey relationships between distant sections of text. This complexity is particularly evident in widely used PDF documents, which represent information visually. This paper addresses this gap by introducing M3T, a novel benchmark dataset tailored to evaluate NMT systems on the comprehensive task of translating semi-structured documents. This dataset aims to bridge the evaluation gap in document-level NMT systems, acknowledging the challenges posed by rich text layouts in real-world applications.

Assuming they are pulsating in either the fundamental or first over-tone radial mode the majority are located at a distance greater than 3kpc, with several being more than 20 kpc distant. Most stars are at least 1 kpc from the Galactic plane, with three being more than 10 kpc. One is located in the direction of the Galactic anti-center and has Galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc and is ~20 kpc below the plane: they are therefore potential tracers of Galactic structure. We have obtained low-resolution spectra for a small number our targets and find they have temperatures between 7200--7900K and a metal content less than Solar. The colours of the pulsators and the spectral fits to those stars for which we have spectra indicate that they are either SX Phe or delta Scuti stars.

First, we prove that if $\mathcal{Q}$ is relatively congruence-distributive, then it has the $\mathcal{Q}$-congruence extension property if and only if $\mathcal{Q}_{_\text{RFSI}}$ has this property.

We then show that, in contrast, exactly sixty varieties of commutative idempotent semilinear residuated lattices have the amalgamation property, and hence exactly sixty axiomatic extensions of the corresponding logic with exchange have the deductive interpolation property.

0000-0002-6608-330X,Pieter Kok,The University of Sheffield,Quantum Interferometric Sensors,1970,"  Quantum entanglement has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of interferometric sensing by providing many orders of magnitude improvement in interferometer sensitivity. The quantum-entangled particle interferometer approach is very general and applies to many types of interferometers. In particular, without nonlocal entanglement, a generic classical interferometer has a statistical-sampling shot-noise limited sensitivity that scales like $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles passing through the interferometer per unit time. However, if carefully prepared quantum correlations are engineered between the particles, then the interferometer sensitivity improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ to scale like 1/N, which is the limit imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For optical interferometers operating at milliwatts of optical power, this quantum sensitivity boost corresponds to an eight-order-of-magnitude improvement of signal to noise. This effect can translate into a tremendous science pay-off for space missions. For example, one application of this new effect is to fiber optical gyroscopes for deep-space inertial guidance and tests of General Relativity (Gravity Probe B). Another application is to ground and orbiting optical interferometers for gravity wave detection, Laser Interferometer Gravity Observatory (LIGO) and the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), respectively. Other applications are to Satellite-to-Satellite laser Interferometry (SSI) proposed for the next generation Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE II).

It produces joint forecasts for all vehicles on a road scene as sequences of multi-modal probability density functions of their positions. Its architecture uses multi-head attention to account for complete interactions between all vehicles, and long short-term memory layers for encoding and forecasting. It relies solely on vehicle position tracks, does not need maneuver definitions, and does not represent the scene with a spatial grid. This allows it to be more versatile than similar model while combining any forecasting capabilities, namely joint forecast with interactions, uncertainty estimation, and multi-modality.

This numerical strategy leads to high compression rates, error control and its high accuracy has been explained on uniform and dynamically adaptive grids. However, one key issue with non-uniform meshes within the framework of lattice Boltzmann schemes is to properly handle acoustic waves passing through a level jump of the grid. It usually yields spurious effects, in particular reflected waves. In this paper, we propose a simple mono-dimensional test-case for the linear wave equation with a fixed adapted mesh characterized by a potentially large level jump. We investigate this configuration with our original strategy and prove that we can handle and control the amplitude of the reflected wave, which is of fourth order in the space step of the finest mesh. Numerical illustrations show that the proposed strategy outperforms the existing methods in the literature and allow to assess the ability of the method to handle the mesh jump properly.

Even though the Planck satellite has so far not detected any primordial non-Gaussianity, it has tightened the constraints significantly, and it is important to better understand what regions of inflation model space have been ruled out, as well as prepare for the next generation of experiments that might reach the important milestone of Delta f_NL(local) = 1. We derive an alternative formulation of the previously derived integral expression for f_NL, which makes it easier to physically interpret the result and see which types of potentials can produce large non-Gaussianity. We apply this to the case of a sum potential and show that it is very difficult to satisfy simultaneously the conditions for a large f_NL and the observational constraints on the spectral index n_s. In the case of the sum of two monomial potentials and a constant we explicitly show in which small region of parameter space this is possible, and we show how to construct such a model. Finally, the new general expression for f_NL also allows us to prove that for the sum potential the explicit expressions derived within the slow-roll approximation remain valid even when the slow-roll approximation is broken during the turn of the field trajectory (as long as only the epsilon slow-roll parameter remains small).

0009-0003-3065-4267,Evgenii Chzhen,Universit辿 Paris-Saclay,Classification with abstention but without disparities,1970,"  Classification with abstention has gained a lot of attention in recent years as it allows to incorporate human decision-makers in the process. Yet, abstention can potentially amplify disparities and lead to discriminatory predictions. The goal of this work is to build a general purpose classification algorithm, which is able to abstain from prediction, while avoiding disparate impact. We formalize this problem as risk minimization under fairness and abstention constraints for which we derive the form of the optimal classifier. Building on this result, we propose a post-processing classification algorithm, which is able to modify any off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only unlabeled sample. We establish finite sample risk, fairness, and abstention guarantees for the proposed algorithm. In particular, it is shown that fairness and abstention constraints can be achieved independently from the initial classifier as long as sufficiently many unlabeled data is available. The risk guarantee is established in terms of the quality of the initial classifier. Our post-processing scheme reduces to a sparse linear program allowing for an efficient implementation, which we provide. Finally, we validate our method empirically showing that moderate abstention rates allow to bypass the risk-fairness trade-off. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2102.12258v1,Yes,potent(1)

However, a key obstacle in achieving this goal is that many relevant processes may not be observed in practice.

It also allows the number of unobserved processes to be unknown and potentially larger than the number of observed nodes.

Traditionally, MDTC methods employ a shared-private paradigm, with a shared feature extractor for domain-invariant knowledge and individual private feature extractors for domain-specific knowledge. Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, these methods grapple with the escalating model parameters due to the continuous addition of new domains. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stochastic Adversarial Network (SAN), which innovatively models the parameters of the domain-specific feature extractor as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, as opposed to a traditional weight vector. This design allows for the generation of numerous domain-specific feature extractors without a substantial increase in model parameters, maintaining the model's size on par with that of a single domain-specific extractor. Furthermore, our approach integrates domain label smoothing and robust pseudo-label regularization to fortify the stability of adversarial training and to refine feature discriminability, respectively. The performance of our SAN, evaluated on two leading MDTC benchmarks, demonstrates its competitive edge against the current state-of-the-art methodologies.

In the modelling, the normal mode analysis (NMA) of potential energy landscape (PEL) picture is employed to describe mechanical alpha and beta relaxations in a glassy material. The model indicates that a small beta relaxation can lead to an apparent double-peak phenomenon resulted from the free vibration of a glass beam when the frequency of beta relaxation peak is close to the natural frequency of specimen. The theoretical prediction is validated by the acoustic spectrum of a fluorosilicate glass beam excited by a mid-span impulse. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate a negative temperature-dependence of the frequency of beta relaxation in the fluorosilicate glass S-FSL5 which can be explained based on the physical picture of fragmented oxide-network patches in liquid-like regions.

Presently, two dominant paradigms for collecting tuning data are natural-instruct (human-written) and self-instruct (automatically generated). Natural-instruct includes diverse and correct codes but lacks instruction-code pairs, and exists improper code formats like nested single-line codes. In contrast, self-instruct automatically generates proper paired data. However, it suffers from low diversity due to generating duplicates and cannot ensure the correctness of codes. To bridge the both paradigms, we propose \textbf{Semi-Instruct}. It first converts diverse but improper codes from natural-instruct into proper instruction-code pairs through a method similar to self-instruct. To verify the correctness of generated codes, we design a novel way to construct test cases by generating cases' inputs and executing correct codes from natural-instruct to get outputs. Finally, diverse and correct instruction-code pairs are retained for instruction tuning. Experiments show that semi-instruct is significantly better than natural-instruct and self-instruct.

In multimode setups, these states manifest a wide range of phenomena when the photon is added or subtracted in a mode-tunable way. In this contribution, we derive the truncated correlations, which are multimode generalisations of cumulants, between quadratures in different modes as statistical signatures of these states. These correlations are then used to obtain the full multimode Wigner function, the properties of which are subsequently studied. In particular we investigate the effect of impurity in the subtraction or addition process, and evaluate its impact on the negativity of the Wigner function. Finally, we elaborate on the generation of inherent entanglement through subtraction or addition of a photon from a pure squeezed vacuum.

It is ultimately limited by the quantum nature of light, which introduces fluctuations in the optical measurements and leads to the so-called Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). We propose a new scheme combining homodyne detection and mode-locked femtosecond lasers that lead to a new SQL in time transfer, potentially reaching the yoctosecond range (10^-21-10^-24 s). We prove that no other measurement strategy can lead to better sensitivity with shot noise limited light. We then demonstrate that this already very low SQL can be overcome using appropriately multimode squeezed light. Benefitting from the large number of photons used in the experiment and from the optimal choice of both the detection strategy and of the quantum resource, the proposed scheme represents a significant potential improvement in space-time positioning.

We develop a theory describing different subtraction schemes in a unified approach and we introduce the concept of subtraction modes intrinsic to the process. The matching between the subtraction modes and the modes of the field defines different possible scenarios for the photon subtraction. In particular, our framework identifies: the conditions of pure photon subtraction, the quantum states of the field modes conditioned to the photon subtraction, the mode with the highest fidelity with a single-photon state when the subtraction is performed on multimode squeezed light. We use our theory to analyze the photon subtraction from a highly multimode quantum resource - a train of quantum squeezed or correlated optical pulses. Performing the photon subtraction optimally on various multimode light field has the potential to implement a number of quantum information protocols in a multiplexed and scalable way.

In 2008, a scheme combining homodyne detection and mode-locked femtosecond lasers was proposed that leads to a potential timing precision reaching the yoctosecond range; with a multimode quantum frequency comb as the input field, the sub-shot noise measurement for the time transfer can further improve the timing precision. Based on this scheme and applying the multimode squeezing frequency comb that was measured to have a phase quadrature quantum noise reduction of 1.5 dB at the analyzing frequency 2MHz, the measurable timing fluctuation was reduced from a shot-noise limited value of 8.9E-23s to 7.5E-23s.

0000-0001-9778-9025,Claude Fabre,Sorbonne University,Frequency multiplexed entanglement for continuous-variable quantum key   distribution,1970,"  Quantum key distribution with continuous variables already uses advantageous high-speed single-mode homodyne detection with low electronic noise at room temperature. Together with continuous-variable information encoding to nonclassical states, the distance for secure key transmission through lossy channels can approach 300 km in current optical fibers. Such protocols tolerate higher channel noise and also limited data processing efficiency compared to coherent-state protocols. The secret key rate can be further increased by increasing the system clock rates, and, further, by a suitable frequency-mode-multiplexing of optical transmission channels. However, the multiplexed modes couple together in the source or any other part of the protocol. Therefore, multiplexed communication will experience crosstalk and the gain can be minuscule. Advantageously, homodyne detectors allow solving this crosstalk problem by proper data processing. It is a potential advantage over protocols with single-photon detectors, which do not enable similar data processing techniques. We demonstrate the positive outcome of this methodology on the experimentally characterized frequency-multiplexed entangled source of femtosecond optical pulses with natural crosstalk between eight entangled pairs of modes. As the main result, we predict almost 15-fold higher secret key rate. This experimental test and analysis of frequency-multiplexed entanglement source opens the way for the field implementation of high-capacity quantum key distribution with continuous variables.

Optical turbulence is a fundamental limitation for applications such as free-space optical communications, where it limits the achievable bandwidth, and ground-based optical astronomy, restricting the observational precision. Knowledge of the turbulence enables us to select the best sites, design optical instrumentation and optimise the operation of ground-based optical systems. The 24hSHIMM estimates the vertical optical turbulence coherence length, time, angle and Rytov variance from the measurement of a four-layer vertical turbulence profile and a wind speed profile retrieved from meteorological forecasts. To illustrate our advance we show the values of these parameters recorded during a 35-hour, continuous demonstration of the instrument. Due to its portability and ability to work in stronger turbulence, the 24hSHIMM can also operate in urban locations, providing the field with a truly continuous, versatile turbulence monitor for all but the most demanding of applications.

Here, we compare dynamical heat transport within the non-inflated hot Jupiter WASP-43b and the canonical inflated hot Jupiter HD 209458b, with similar effective temperatures. We investigate to what extent the radiatively driven heating and cooling in the photosphere (at pressures smaller than 1 bar) influence the deeper temperature profile (at pressures between 1 to 700 bar). Our simulations with the new non-gray 3D radiation-hydrodynamical model expeRT/MITgcm show that the deep temperature profile of WASP-43b is associated with a relatively cold adiabat. The deep layers of HD 209458b, however, do not converge and remain nearly unchanged regardless of whether a cold or a hot initial state is used. Furthermore, we show that different flow structures in the deep atmospheric layers arise. There, we find that WASP-43b exhibits a deep equatorial jet, driven by the relatively fast tidally locked rotation of this planet (0.81 days), as compared to HD 209458b (3.47 days). However, by comparing simulations with different rotation periods, we find that the resulting flow structures only marginally influence the temperature evolution in the deep atmosphere, which is almost completely dominated by radiative heating and cooling. Furthermore, we find that the evolution of deeper layers can influence the 3D temperature structure in the photosphere of WASP-43b. Thus, dayside emission spectra of WASP-43b may shed more light onto the dynamical processes occurring at greater depths. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2202.09183v4,Yes,potent(1)

One mechanism which has been proposed to bridge this gap, and which has recently come under scrutiny, is the vertical advection of potential temperature from the irradiated outer atmosphere deep into the interior, heating the deep, unirradiated, atmosphere, warming the internal adiabat, and resulting in radius inflation. Specifically, a recent study which explored the atmosphere of WASP-76b using a 3D, non-grey, GCM suggested that their models lacked radius inflation, and hence any vertical enthalpy advection. Here we perform additional analysis of these, and related, models, focusing on an explicit analysis of vertical enthalpy transport and the resulting heating of the deep atmosphere compared with 1D models. Our results indicate that, after any evolution linked with initialisation, all the WASP-76b models considered here exhibit significant vertical enthalpy transport, heating the deep atmosphere significantly when compared with standard 1D models. Furthermore, comparison of a long time-scale (and hence near steady-state) model with a Jupiter-like internal-structure model suggests not only strong radius-inflation, but also that the model radius, $1.98 \mathrm{R_{J}}$, may be comparable with observations ($1.83\pm0.06 \mathrm{R_{J}}$). We thus conclude that the vertical advection of potential temperature alone is enough to explain the radius inflation of WASP-76b, and potentially other irradiated gas giants, albeit with the proviso that the exact strength of the vertical advection remains sensitive to model parameters, such as the inclusion of deep atmospheric drag.

We find that Jeans or hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately valid for galaxies of stellar masses above $M_\star \!\sim\! 10^{9.5}M_\odot$ out to $5$ effective radii ($R_e$). When both measurements of the rotation velocity $v_\phi$ and of the radial velocity dispersion $\sigma_r$ are available, the dynamical mass $M_{\rm dyn} \!\simeq\! G^{-1} V_c^2 r$ can be evaluated from the Jeans equation $V_c^2= v_\phi^2 + \alpha \sigma_r^2$ assuming cylindrical symmetry and a constant, isotropic $\sigma_r$. For spheroids, $\alpha$ is inversely proportional to the S\'ersic index $n$ and $\alpha \simeq 2.5$ within $R_e$ for the simulated galaxies. The prediction for a self-gravitating exponential disc, $\alpha = 3.36(r/R_e)$, is invalid in the simulations, where the dominant spheroid causes a weaker gradient from $\alpha \!\simeq\! 1$ at $R_e$ to 4 at $5R_e$. The correction in $\alpha$ for the stars due to the gradient in $\sigma_r(r)$ is roughly balanced by the effect of the aspherical potential, while the effect of anisotropy is negligible. When only the effective projected velocity dispersion $\sigma_l$ is available, the dynamical mass can be evaluated as $M_{\rm dyn} = K G^{-1} R_e \sigma_l^2$, where the virial factor $K$ is derived from $\alpha$ given the inclination and $v_\phi/\sigma_r$.

SignCLIP is an efficient method of learning useful visual representations for sign language processing from large-scale, multilingual video-text pairs, without directly optimizing for a specific task or sign language which is often of limited size.   We pretrain SignCLIP on Spreadthesign, a prominent sign language dictionary consisting of ~500 thousand video clips in up to 44 sign languages, and evaluate it with various downstream datasets. SignCLIP discerns in-domain signing with notable text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval accuracy. It also performs competitively for out-of-domain downstream tasks such as isolated sign language recognition upon essential few-shot prompting or fine-tuning.   We analyze the latent space formed by the spoken language text and sign language poses, which provides additional linguistic insights. Our code and models are openly available.

0000-0003-3342-9906,Dixeena Lopez,University of Zurich,Prospects for detecting and localizing short-duration transient   gravitational waves from glitching neutron stars without electromagnetic   counterparts,1970,"  Neutron stars are known to show accelerated spin-up of their rotational frequency called a glitch. Highly magnetized rotating neutron stars (pulsars) are frequently observed by radio telescopes (and in other frequencies), where the glitch is observed as irregular arrival times of pulses which are otherwise very regular. A glitch in an isolated neutron star can excite the fundamental (f)-mode oscillations which can lead to gravitational wave generation. Electromagnetic observations of pulsars (and hence pulsar glitches) require the pulsar to be oriented so that the jet is pointed toward the detector, but this is not a requirement for gravitational wave emission which is more isotropic and not jetlike. Hence, gravitational wave observations have the potential to uncover nearby neutron stars where the jet is not pointed towards the Earth. In this work, we study the prospects of finding glitching neutron stars using a generic all-sky search for short-duration gravitational wave transients. The analysis covers the high-frequency range from $1-4$ kHz of LIGO-Virgo detectors for signals up to a few seconds. We set upper limits for the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo detectors and present the prospects for upcoming observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO India. We find the detectable glitch size will be around $10^{-5}$ Hz for the fifth observing run for pulsars with spin frequencies and distances comparable to the Vela pulsar. We also present the prospects of localizing the direction in the sky of these sources with gravitational waves alone, which can facilitate electromagnetic follow-up. We find that for the five detector configuration, the localization capability for a glitch size of $10^{-5}$ Hz is around $132\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence for $50\%$ of events with distance and spin frequency as that of Vela.

0000-0003-0362-7848,David McKay,University of St Andrews,Metastable Bose-Einstein Condensation in a Strongly Correlated Optical   Lattice,1970,"  We experimentally and theoretically study the peak fraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a cubic optical lattice as the lattice potential depth and entropy per particle are varied. This system is well-described by the superfluid regime of the Bose-Hubbard model, which allows for comparison with mean-field theories and exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Despite correcting for systematic discrepancies between condensate fraction and peak fraction, we discover that the experiment consistently shows the presence of a condensate at temperatures higher than the critical temperature predicted by QMC simulations. This metastability suggests that turning on the lattice potential is non-adiabatic. To confirm this behavior, we compute the timescales for relaxation in this system, and find that equilibration times are comparable with the known heating rates. The similarity of these timescales implies that turning on the lattice potential adiabatically may be impossible. Our results point to the urgent need for a better theoretical and experimental understanding of the timescales for relaxation and adiabaticity in strongly interacting quantum gases, and the importance of model-independent probes of thermometry in optical lattices.

Recently, new software mention datasets with different characteristics have been published. We present an approach to assess the usability of such datasets for research on research software. Our approach includes sampling and data preparation, manual annotation for quality and mention characteristics, and annotation analysis. We applied it to two software mention datasets for evaluation based on qualitative observation. Doing this, we were able to find challenges to working with the selected datasets to do research. Main issues refer to the structure of the dataset, the quality of the extracted mentions (54% and 23% of mentions respectively are not to software), and software accessibility. While one dataset does not provide links to mentioned software at all, the other does so in a way that can impede quantitative research endeavors: (1) Links may come from different sources and each point to different software for the same mention. (2) The quality of the automatically retrieved links is generally poor (in our sample, 65.4% link the wrong software). (3) Links exist only for a small subset (in our sample, 20.5%) of mentions, which may lead to skewed or disproportionate samples. However, the greatest challenge and underlying issue in working with software mention datasets is the still suboptimal practice of software citation: Software should not be mentioned, it should be cited following the software citation principles.

Here we report a triple anion (TA) perovskite CH3NH3PbI2.6(BrCl)0.2 with a tailored bandgap suitable for maximizing indoor light harvesting compared to methyl ammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3. The best-performing TA perovskite indoor-photovoltaic device achieved a steady-state power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.1% with an output power density of ~ 75 microW/cm2 under 1000 lux indoor illumination   (0.3 mW/cm2 irradiance). This PCE is almost 40% higher than that of equivalent CH3NH3PbI3-based devices (PCE of 17.9%). Longer carrier lifetime, reduced density of trap states and improved crystalline quality were achieved by the triple anion alloying method. The decisive role of chlorine (Cl) in the better performance of TA-based indoor photovoltaic devices was further investigated by successively reducing the Cl content and correlating it with the corresponding photovoltaic device performance. Replacing the commonly used hole transporting layer of Spiro-MeOTAD with undoped P3HT was found to significantly reduce the current-voltage hysteresis under indoor lighting conditions. A graphene-coated textile fiber-based temperature sensor was successfully powered by the triple anion perovskite indoor photovoltaic devices. The results from the present study demonstrate a novel route to maximize the PCE of halide perovskite indoor photovoltaic devices and their potential for application in the IoT industry.

Relying on temporal logic modeling capabilities and automated model checking tools, we built a framework to formally model HRC systems and verify the physical safety of human operator against ISO 10218-2 [10] standard. In order to make our proposed formal verification framework more appealing to safety engineers, whom are usually not very fond of formal modeling and verification techniques, we decided to couple our model checking approach with a 3D simulator that demonstrates the potential hazardous situations to the safety engineers in a more transparent way.

The fRG flow equations outlined here provide a concrete way to compute the EA and thus solve the derived EEOM. The obtained effective potential should determine directly the exact equilibrium statistics, name the position, the variance, as well as all higher order cumulants of the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution.

After reviewing the functional integral formulation of the system and its underlying symmetries, including the resulting Ward-Takahashi identities for arbitrary initial conditions, we compute the effective action $\Gamma$ from the fRG, approximated in terms of the leading and subleading terms in the gradient expansion: the Local Potential Approximation and Wavefunction Renormalisation respectively. This is achieved by coarse-graining the thermal fluctuations in time resulting in e.g. an effective potential incorporating fluctuations at all timescales. We then use the resulting effective equations of motion to describe the decay of the covariance, and the relaxation of the average position and variance towards their equilibrium values at different temperatures. We use as examples a simple polynomial potential, an unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and a more complex potential with multiple trapping wells and barriers. We find that these are all handled well, with the accuracy of the approximations improving as the relaxation's spectral representation shifts to lower eigenvalues, in line with expectations about the validity of the gradient expansion. The spectral representation's range also correlates with temperature, leading to the conclusion that the gradient expansion works better for higher temperatures than lower ones. This work demonstrates the ability of the fRG to expedite the computation of statistical objects in otherwise long-timescale simulations, acting as a first step to more complicated systems.

When supporting a limb with a cable, force sensors are often used to measure tension. However, force sensors add cost, complexity, and distal components. This paper presents a design and control approach to remove the force sensor from an upper limb cable-driven exosuit. A mechanical design for the exosuit was developed to maximize passive transparency. Then, a data-driven friction identification was conducted on a mannequin test bench to design a model-based tension controller. Seventeen healthy participants raised and lowered their right arms to evaluate tension tracking, movement quality, and muscular effort. Questionnaires on discomfort, physical exertion, and fatigue were collected. The proposed strategy allowed tracking the desired assistive torque with an RMSE of 0.71 Nm (18%) at 50% gravity support. During the raising phase, the EMG signals of the anterior deltoid, trapezius, and pectoralis major were reduced on average compared to the no-suit condition by 30%, 38%, and 38%, respectively. The posterior deltoid activity was increased by 32% during lowering. Position tracking was not significantly altered, whereas movement smoothness significantly decreased. This work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of removing the force sensor from a cable-driven exosuit.

By relying on this simplified model of the structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of different length. The training of the neural network is done before the monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage classification.

Measurement noise has been added to the responses of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system.

With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models.

However, given the proven power of latent factor models, some newer neural approaches incorporate them within more complex network architectures. One specific idea, recently put forward by several researchers, is to consider potential correlations between the latent factors, i.e., embeddings, by applying convolutions over the user-item interaction map. However, contrary to what is claimed in these articles, such interaction maps do not share the properties of images where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly useful. In this work, we show through analytical considerations and empirical evaluations that the claimed gains reported in the literature cannot be attributed to the ability of CNNs to model embedding correlations, as argued in the original papers. Moreover, additional performance evaluations show that all of the examined recent CNN-based models are outperformed by existing non-neural machine learning techniques or traditional nearest-neighbor approaches.

In a recent work, linear regression was formulated as a quadratic binary optimization problem that can be solved via quantum annealing. Although this approach promises a computational time advantage for large datasets, the quality of the solution is limited by the necessary use of a precision vector, used to approximate the real-numbered regression coefficients in the quantum formulation. In this work, we focus on the practical challenge of improving the precision vector encoding: instead of setting an array of generic values equal for all coefficients, we allow each one to be expressed by its specific precision, which is tuned with a simple adaptive algorithm. This approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets of increasing size, and linear regression is solved using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer, as well as classical solvers.

High-resolution STM imaging and the high sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to the bond nature provide a unique strategy to unravel the atomic-scale properties of sp-sp2 carbon nanostructures. We show that hybridization between the 2D carbon nanonetwork and the underlying substrate states strongly affects its electronic and vibrational properties, modifying substantially the density of states and the Raman spectrum compared to the free standing system. This opens the way to the modulation of the electronic properties with significant prospects in future applications as active nanomaterials for catalysis, photoconversion and carbon-based nanoelectronics.

In the Von Neumann architecture, processing and memory units are implemented as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power consumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann type architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and will not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with complex data as our brain does. These needs can be addressed by neuromorphic computing systems which are inspired by the biological concepts of the human brain. This new generation of computers has the potential to be used for the storage and processing of large amounts of digital information with much lower power consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future applications, an important niche is moving the control from data centers to edge devices.   The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of neuromorphic technology and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds in the major areas of neuromorphic technology, namely materials, devices, neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic algorithms, applications, and ethics. The Roadmap is a collection of perspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic community provide their own view about the current state and the future challenges. We hope that this Roadmap will be a useful resource to readers outside this field, for those who are just entering the field, and for those who are well established in the neuromorphic community. https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/ac4a83 ",https://doi.org/10.1088/2634-4386/ac4a83,2105.05956v3,Yes,potent(2)

Since neutrons cannot directly ionize, their detection is only possible via nuclear reactions. Consequently, neutron-based experimental techniques are related to the detection of charged particle or electromagnetic radiation originating from neutron-induced reactions. The study of fast neutrons is often based on the neutron-proton elastic scattering reaction. In this case, the ionization induced by the recoil protons in a hydrogenous material constitutes the basic information for the design and development of neutron detectors. Although experimental techniques have continuously improved and refined, so far, proton-recoil track imaging is still weak in laboratory rate environments because of the extremely small detection efficiency. To address this deficiency, we propose a novel recoil-proton track imaging system in which the light deriving from a fast scintillation signal is used to perform a complete reconstruction in space and time of the event. In particular, we report the idea of RIPTIDE (RecoIl Proton Track Imaging DEtector): an innovative system which combines a plastic scintillator coupled to imaging devices, based on CMOS technology, or Micro Channel Plate sensors. The proposed apparatus aims at providing neutron spectrometry capability by stereoscopically imaging the recoil-protons tracks, correlating the spatial information with the time information.

Past gyrotron experiments have highlighted some instability issues, leading to restricted operating ranges. One major cause is the possible presence of trapped electrons within the gyrotron's magnetron injection gun (MIG) region, resulting in undesired currents and subsequent operational failures. Hereby, we present the design and initial experimental findings of the TRapped Electrons eXperiment (T-REX), a novel and unique basic plasma experiment constructed at the Swiss Plasma Center to investigate the underlying physics of trapped electron clouds, therefore entering the realm of non-neutral plasmas. The primary objective is to explore the formation and evolution of electron clouds in gyrotron MIG designs. Typical MIG conditions are replicated in T-REX in terms of geometries, electric and magnetic fields, and supported by kinetic simulations via the 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code FENNECS. T-REX is characterized by two coaxial electrodes, placed in a vacuum chamber on top of a superconducting magnet, with an applied external radial electric field (0.1 - 2 MV/m), and a nearly axial magnetic field (B<0.4T) inducing azimuthal drifts and confining electrons with energies between 0.1-1 keV. The experimental diagnostics include current, voltage, and Faraday probes, and in future plans imaging via phosphor screen, optical emission spectroscopy, streak camera imaging, and, potentially, electric field distribution via the Stark effect. Moreover, T-REX is also designed to be capable of detecting potential growth of diocotron modes via such diagnostics in combination with a segmented outer electrode. Through T-REX, we aim to gain valuable insights into the trapping and dynamics of electrons within MIG regions, paving the way for improved gyrotron performance and reliability in magnetic fusion reactors.

There is a growing interest in developing legged robots that move like their biological counterparts and show various agile skills to navigate complex environments quickly. Despite the interest, the field lacks systematic benchmarks to measure the performance of control policies and hardware in agility. We introduce the Barkour benchmark, an obstacle course to quantify agility for legged robots. Inspired by dog agility competitions, it consists of diverse obstacles and a time based scoring mechanism. This encourages researchers to develop controllers that not only move fast, but do so in a controllable and versatile way. To set strong baselines, we present two methods for tackling the benchmark. In the first approach, we train specialist locomotion skills using on-policy reinforcement learning methods and combine them with a high-level navigation controller. In the second approach, we distill the specialist skills into a Transformer-based generalist locomotion policy, named Locomotion-Transformer, that can handle various terrains and adjust the robot's gait based on the perceived environment and robot states. Using a custom-built quadruped robot, we demonstrate that our method can complete the course at half the speed of a dog. We hope that our work represents a step towards creating controllers that enable robots to reach animal-level agility. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2305.14654v1,Yes,versatile(1)

The increased realism in image details, diverse content, and widespread accessibility to the general public complicates the identification of these sophisticated deepfakes. Acknowledging the urgency to address the vulnerability of current deepfake detectors to this evolving threat, our paper introduces two extensive deepfake datasets generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models as other datasets are less diverse and low in quality. Our extensive experiments also showed that our dataset is more challenging compared to the other face deepfake datasets. Our strategic dataset creation not only challenge the deepfake detectors but also sets a new benchmark for more evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals the struggle of existing detection methods, often optimized for specific image domains and manipulations, to effectively adapt to the intricate nature of diffusion deepfakes, limiting their practical utility. To address this critical issue, we investigate the impact of enhancing training data diversity on representative detection methods. This involves expanding the diversity of both manipulation techniques and image domains. Our findings underscore that increasing training data diversity results in improved generalizability. Moreover, we propose a novel momentum difficulty boosting strategy to tackle the additional challenge posed by training data heterogeneity. This strategy dynamically assigns appropriate sample weights based on learning difficulty, enhancing the model's adaptability to both easy and challenging samples.

Currently, the most popular one is Open vSwitch (OVS), leveraged in many production-based environments. However, due to its kernel-based nature, OVS is typically complex to modify when additional features or adaptation is required. To this regard, a simpler user-space is key to perform these modifications.   In this article, we present a rich overview of BOFUSS, the basic OpenFlow user-space software switch. BOFUSS has been widely used in the research community for diverse reasons, but it lacked a proper reference document. For this purpose, we describe the switch, its history, architecture, uses cases and evaluation, together with a survey of works that leverage this switch. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the switch and its characteristics. Although the original BOFUSS is not expected to surpass the high performance of OVS, it is a useful complementary artifact that provides some OpenFlow features missing in OVS and it can be easily modified for extended functionality. Moreover, enhancements provided by the BEBA project brought the performance from BOFUSS close to OVS. In any case, this paper sheds light to researchers looking for the trade-offs between performance and customization of BOFUSS. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,1901.06699v1,Yes,pivotal(1)

To simplify the exploration of the vast and intricate trade-off space of latency, accuracy, and cost in inference pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the challenge lies in reconciling latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs. To address this challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep learning Inference Pipeline Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency, and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency Service Level Agreements (SLAs) using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns. Navigating a wider variety of configurations allows \namex{} to achieve better trade-offs between cost and accuracy objectives compared to existing methods.

We initially join together two thermal baths at different temperatures and chemical potentials and compare the subsequent evolution of the combined system to analytic solutions of the corresponding Riemann problem and to numeric solutions of ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. The time evolution of the energy density that we obtain holographically is consistent with the combination of a shock and a rarefaction wave: A shock wave moves towards the cold bath, and a smooth broadening wave towards the hot bath. Between the two waves emerges a steady state with constant temperature and flow velocity, both of which are accurately described by a shock+rarefaction wave solution of the Riemann problem. In the steady state region, a smooth crossover develops between two regions of different charge density. This is reminiscent of a contact discontinuity in the Riemann problem. We also obtain results for the entanglement entropy of regions crossed by shock and rarefaction waves and find both of them to closely follow the evolution of the energy density.

It is composed of scalar Higgs, pseudoscalar Higgs, and antisymmetric tensor components. The Majorana boson sector contributes to flavor mixing and Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos. It is comprised of neutrino Higgs and pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The LHC 750 GeV diphoton resonance might possibly be identified as a Majorana sector pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, which results from spontaneous symmetry breaking of a flavor-related global U(1) symmetry involving four-fermion condensation of right-handed leptons and quarks. The diphoton decay is loop induced, since tree-level decay is suppressed by large Majorana mass of the right-handed neutrino.

Much of the previous work has neglected the important distinction between social influence and actual product adoption. However, as recognized in the management science literature, an individual who gets influenced by social acquaintances may not necessarily adopt a product (or technology), due, e.g., to monetary concerns. In this work, we distinguish between influence and adoption by explicitly modeling the states of being influenced and of adopting a product. We extend the classical Linear Threshold (LT) model to incorporate prices and valuations, and factor them into users' decision-making process of adopting a product. We show that the expected profit function under our proposed model maintains submodularity under certain conditions, but no longer exhibits monotonicity, unlike the expected influence spread function. To maximize the expected profit under our extended LT model, we employ an unbudgeted greedy framework to propose three profit maximization algorithms. The results of our detailed experimental study on three real-world datasets demonstrate that of the three algorithms, \textsf{PAGE}, which assigns prices dynamically based on the profit potential of each candidate seed, has the best performance both in the expected profit achieved and in running time.

A typical CRS is composed of two bipolar memory cells that are connected anti-serially. Here we report a tantalum-oxide based resistive memory that achieves the complementary switching functionality within a single memory cell. The complementary switching effect is accompanied by switching polarity reversal in different voltage bias regimes. These effects were explained by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies inside the tantalum-oxide layers. The effects of symmetry breaking on bipolar switching and complementary switching were also discussed. ,https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4719198,1204.3515v2,Yes,potent(1)

In this case, backdoor attacks can induce the model to exhibit expected behaviors through specific triggers and have little inferior influence on primitive tasks. Hence, it could have dire consequences, especially considering that the backdoor attack surfaces are broad.   However, there is still no systematic and comprehensive review to reflect the security challenges, attacker's capabilities, and purposes according to the attack surface. Moreover, there is a shortage of analysis and comparison of the diverse emerging backdoor countermeasures in this context. In this paper, we conduct a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures to sound the red alarm for the NLP security community. According to the affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into three categorizations: attacking pre-trained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or parameter-efficient tuning (APMP), and attacking final model with training (AFMT). Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Overall, the research on the defense side is far behind the attack side, and there is no single defense that can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. An attacker can intelligently bypass existing defenses with a more invisible attack. Drawing the insights from the systematic review, we also present crucial areas for future research on the backdoor, such as empirical security evaluations on large language models, and in particular, more efficient and practical countermeasures are solicited.

Despite several indicators in previous studies, a consensus measure is still needed to represent the translational features of biomedical research at the article level. In this study, we first trained semantic representations of biomedical entities and documents (i.e., bio entity2vec and bio doc2vec) based on over 30 million PubMed articles. With these vectors, we then developed a new measure called Translational Progression (TP) for tracking biomedical articles along the translational continuum. We validated the effectiveness of TP from two perspectives (Clinical trial phase identification and ACH classification), which showed excellent consistency between TP and other indicators. Meanwhile, TP has several advantages. First, it can track the degree of translation of biomedical research dynamically and in real time. Second, it is straightforward to interpret and operationalize. Third, it doesn%u2019t require labor-intensive MeSH labeling and it is suitable for big scholarly data as well as papers that are not indexed in PubMed. In addition, we examined the translational progressions of biomedical research from three dimensions (including overall distribution, time, and research topic), which revealed three significant findings. The proposed measure in this study could be used by policymakers to monitor biomedical research with high translational potential in real time and make better decisions. It can also be adopted and improved for other domains, such as physics or computer science, to assess the application value of scientific discoveries.

In this work, we propose a theoretical approach based on Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) to investigate such mechanisms. Specifically, considering the infinite network width, we hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening our insights into their internal mechanisms. We apply our approach to several fundamental models and reveal how these models leverage statistical features during gradient descent and how they are integrated into final decisions. We also discovered that the choice of activation function can affect feature extraction. For instance, the use of the \textit{ReLU} activation function could potentially introduce a bias in features, providing a plausible explanation for its replacement with alternative functions in recent pre-trained language models. Additionally, we find that while self-attention and CNN models may exhibit limitations in learning n-grams, multiplication-based models seem to excel in this area. We verify these theoretical findings through experiments and find that they can be applied to analyze language modeling tasks, which can be regarded as a special variant of classification. Our contributions offer insights into the roles and capacities of fundamental components within large language models, thereby aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.

The challenge of verifying data ownership is further amplified by using Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), which often functions as a black-box system.   Our work is dedicated to detecting data reuse from even an individual sample. Traditionally, watermarking has been leveraged to detect AI-generated content. However, unlike watermarking techniques that embed additional information as triggers into models or generated content, potentially compromising output quality, our approach identifies latent fingerprints inherently present within the outputs through re-generation. We propose an explainable verification procedure that attributes data ownership through re-generation, and further amplifies these fingerprints in the generative models through iterative data re-generation. This methodology is theoretically grounded and demonstrates viability and robustness using recent advanced text and image generative models. Our methodology is significant as it goes beyond protecting the intellectual property of APIs and addresses important issues such as the spread of misinformation and academic misconduct.

Given several demonstration examples, the models can implement new tasks without any parameter updates. However, it is still an open question to understand the mechanism of ICL. In this paper, we interpret the inference process of ICL as a gradient descent process in a contrastive learning pattern. Firstly, leveraging kernel methods, we establish the relationship between gradient descent and self-attention mechanism under generally used softmax attention setting instead of linear attention setting. Then, we analyze the corresponding gradient descent process of ICL from the perspective of contrastive learning without negative samples and discuss possible improvements of this contrastive learning pattern, based on which the self-attention layer can be further modified. Finally, we design experiments to support our opinions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide the understanding of ICL from the perspective of contrastive learning and has the potential to facilitate future model design by referring to related works on contrastive learning.

In this paper, we investigate the excess risk performance and towards improved learning rates for two popular approaches of stochastic optimization: empirical risk minimization (ERM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Although there exists plentiful generalization analysis of ERM and SGD for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM and SGD either have stronger assumptions in convex learning, e.g., strong convexity, or show slow rates and less studied in nonconvex learning. Motivated by these problems, we aim to provide improved rates under milder assumptions in convex learning and derive faster rates in nonconvex learning. It is notable that our analysis span two popular theoretical viewpoints: \emph{stability} and \emph{uniform convergence}. Specifically, in stability regime, we present high probability learning rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ w.r.t. the sample size $n$ for ERM and SGD with milder assumptions in convex learning and similar high probability rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/n)$ in nonconvex learning, rather than in expectation. Furthermore, this type of learning rate is improved to faster order $\mathcal{O} (1/n^2)$ in uniform convergence regime.

The framework jointly learns four components: the encoder, the performance predictor, the complexity predictor and the decoder in an end-to-end manner. The encoder and the decoder belong to a graph VAE, mapping architectures between continuous representations and network architectures.

While previous models suffer from complicated series variations induced by changing temporal distribution, we tackle non-stationary time series with modern Koopman theory that fundamentally considers the underlying time-variant dynamics. Inspired by Koopman theory of portraying complex dynamical systems, we disentangle time-variant and time-invariant components from intricate non-stationary series by Fourier Filter and design Koopman Predictor to advance respective dynamics forward. Technically, we propose Koopa as a novel Koopman forecaster composed of stackable blocks that learn hierarchical dynamics. Koopa seeks measurement functions for Koopman embedding and utilizes Koopman operators as linear portraits of implicit transition. To cope with time-variant dynamics that exhibits strong locality, Koopa calculates context-aware operators in the temporal neighborhood and is able to utilize incoming ground truth to scale up forecast horizon. Besides, by integrating Koopman Predictors into deep residual structure, we ravel out the binding reconstruction loss in previous Koopman forecasters and achieve end-to-end forecasting objective optimization.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to approximate the mutual information between the high-dimensional gradients and batched input data. Experimental results show that the proposed metric reliably reflect the extent of information leakage in federated learning.

However, particularly for generative SSL methods, its potential in Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) remains relatively underexplored. Generative SSL utilizes an encoder to map the input graph into a latent representation and a decoder to recover the input graph from the latent representation. Previous HGL SSL methods generally design complex strategies to capture graph heterogeneity, which heavily rely on contrastive view construction strategies that are often non-trivial. Yet, refining the latent representation in generative SSL can effectively improve graph learning results. In this study, we propose HGVAE, a generative SSL method specially designed for HGL.

Here we have adopted a first-principles calculation method to predict the magnetic properties of intrinsic, Se-doped, and biaxial strain tuning Cr$_2$AsP monolayer. The Janus Cr$_2$AsP monolayer is proved to be an intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor with a exchange splitting bandgap of 0.15 eV at the PBE+U level. Concentration-dependent Se doping such as Cr$_2$As$_{1-x}$Se$_x$P (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) can regulate Cr$_2$AsP from FM semiconductor to FM half-metallicity. Specifically, the spin-up channel crosses the Fermi level, while the spin-down channel has a bandgap. More interestingly, the wide half-metallic bandgaps and spin bandgaps make them have important implications for the preparation of spintronic devices. At last, we also explore the effect of biaxial strain from -14% to 10% on the magnetism of the Cr$_2$AsP monolayer. There appears a transition from FM to antiferromagnetic (AFM) at a compressive strain of -10.7%, originating from the competition between the indirect FM superexchange interaction and the direct AFM interaction between the nearest-neighbor Cr atoms.

In this study, the CrONM monolayer family (N=F, Cl; M=Br, Cl) was investigated using first-principles calculations, revealing that the Janus CrOFBr monolayer exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductor behavior along with a significant out-of-plane piezoelectric effect. The calculated out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ are up to 1.21 and 0.63 pm/V, respectively. These values are greater than those of the majority of 2D materials. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that applying tensile strain can enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric response, leading to a respective 27% and 67% augmentation in the piezoelectric strain coefficients d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ compared to the unstrained configurations. This discovery holds great potential for propelling the field of nanoelectronics forward and facilitating the development of multifunctional semiconductor spintronic applications. Finally, by comparing d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ of the CrONM monolayer family (N=F, Cl; M=Br, Cl), we find that the magnitudes of d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ are correlated with the electronegativity difference between the M and N atoms. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of 2D piezoelectric materials with enhanced vertical piezoelectric responses. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2406.06265v1,Yes,potent(1)

Conventionally, a molecule graph can be represented either as a graph-structured data or a SMILES text. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of NLP. Although it is natural to utilize LLMs to assist in understanding molecules represented by SMILES, the exploration of how LLMs will impact molecular property prediction is still in its early stage. In this work, we advance towards this objective through two perspectives: zero/few-shot molecular classification, and using the new explanations generated by LLMs as representations of molecules. To be specific, we first prompt LLMs to do in-context molecular classification and evaluate their performance. After that, we employ LLMs to generate semantically enriched explanations for the original SMILES and then leverage that to fine-tune a small-scale LM model for multiple downstream tasks. The experimental results highlight the superiority of text explanations as molecular representations across multiple benchmark datasets, and confirm the immense potential of LLMs in molecular property prediction tasks.

GAEs typically rely on distance-based criteria, such as mean-square-error (MSE), to reconstruct the input graph. However, relying solely on a single reconstruction criterion may lead to a loss of distinctiveness in the reconstructed graph, causing nodes to collapse into similar representations and resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we have developed a simple yet effective strategy to preserve the necessary distinctness in the reconstructed graph. Inspired by the knowledge distillation technique, we found that the dual encoder-decoder architecture of GAEs can be viewed as a teacher-student relationship. Therefore, we propose transferring the knowledge of distinctness from the raw graph to the reconstructed graph, achieved through a simple KL constraint. Specifically, we compute pairwise node similarity scores in the raw graph and reconstructed graph. During the training process, the KL constraint is optimized alongside the reconstruction criterion. We conducted extensive experiments across three types of graph tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our strategy. This indicates that the proposed approach can be employed as a plug-and-play method to avoid vague reconstructions and enhance overall performance.

We develop a low-latency FoV-adaptive coding and streaming system for interactive applications that is robust to bandwidth variations and FoV prediction errors. To minimize the end-to-end delay and yet maximize the coding efficiency, we propose a frame-level FoV-adaptive inter-coding structure. In each frame, regions that are in or near the predicted FoV are coded using temporal and spatial prediction, while a small rotating region is coded with spatial prediction only. This rotating intra region periodically refreshes the entire frame, thereby providing robustness to both FoV prediction errors and frame losses due to transmission errors. The system adapts the sizes and rates of different regions for each video segment to maximize the rendered video quality under the predicted bandwidth constraint. Integrating such frame-level FoV adaptation with temporal prediction is challenging due to the temporal variations of the FoV. We propose novel ways for modeling the influence of FoV dynamics on the quality-rate performance of temporal predictive coding.We further develop LSTM-based machine learning models to predict the user's FoV and network bandwidth.The proposed system is compared with three benchmark systems, using real-world network bandwidth traces and FoV traces, and is shown to significantly improve the rendered video quality, while achieving very low end-to-end delay and low frame-freeze probability.

These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps.

Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) optimizers, recently proposed to address this issue, only require forward passes during training, making them more memory-friendly.

In recommender systems for instance, the action is to choose what to recommend, and the optimization task is to recommend items the user prefers. The optimization is done based on earlier user's feedback (e.g. ""likes"" and ""dislikes""), and the algorithms assume the feedback to be faithful. That is, when the user clicks ""like,"" they actually prefer the item. We argue that this fundamental assumption can be extensively violated by human users, who are not passive feedback sources. Instead, they are in control, actively steering the system towards their goal. To verify this hypothesis, that humans steer and are able to improve performance by steering, we designed a function optimization task where a human and an optimization algorithm collaborate to find the maximum of a 1-dimensional function. At each iteration, the optimization algorithm queries the user for the value of a hidden function $f$ at a point $x$, and the user, who sees the hidden function, provides an answer about $f(x)$. Our study on 21 participants shows that users who understand how the optimization works, strategically provide biased answers (answers not equal to $f(x)$), which results in the algorithm finding the optimum significantly faster. Our work highlights that next-generation intelligent systems will need user models capable of helping users who steer systems to pursue their goals.

This paper presents a study on the design and impedance matching of long-range NFC coils, focusing on optimizing antenna performance over distances exceeding one meter. Through numerical analyses of various coil geometries, including single-turn and multi-wire configurations, we explore the effects of coil size, wire separation, and current distribution on magnetic field generation. Additionally, an adaptive impedance matching approach is proposed to maintain efficient power transfer, significantly improving field strength and system performance. The proposed designs demonstrate superior interrogation distances compared to existing configurations, highlighting the potential for enhanced long-range NFC applications.

0000-0003-2443-7242,Klemens Winkler,University of Vienna,Nonequilibrium entanglement between levitated masses under optimal   control,1970,"  We present a protocol that maximizes unconditional entanglement generation between two masses interacting directly through $1/r^{n}$ potential. The protocol combines optimal quantum control of continuously measured masses with their non-equilibrium dynamics, driven by a time-dependent interaction strength. Applied to a pair of optically trapped sub-micron particles coupled via electrostatic interaction, our protocol enables unconditional entanglement generation at the fundamental limit of the conditional state and with an order of magnitude smaller interaction between the masses compared to the existing steady-state approaches.

0000-0002-3900-1532,Peter Schiansky,"University Of Vienna, University of Vienna",Demonstration of quantum-digital payments,1970,"  Digital payments have replaced physical banknotes in many aspects of our daily lives. Similarly to banknotes, they should be easy to use, unique, tamper-resistant and untraceable, but additionally withstand digital attackers and data breaches. Current technology substitutes customers' sensitive data by randomized tokens, and secures the payment's uniqueness with a cryptographic function, called a cryptogram. However, computationally powerful attacks violate the security of these functions. Quantum technology comes with the potential to protect even against infinite computational power. Here, we show how quantum light can secure daily digital payments by generating inherently unforgeable quantum cryptograms. We implement the scheme over an urban optical fiber link, and show its robustness to noise and loss-dependent attacks. Unlike previously proposed protocols, our solution does not depend on long-term quantum storage or trusted agents and authenticated channels. It is practical with near-term technology and may herald an era of quantum-enabled security. ",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39519-w,2305.14504v2,Yes,potent(1)

To discover, model, and predict these dynamics, we use a method based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). The resulting data-driven dynamical system involves constant and linear terms but does not include nonlinear interactions between cells. Results show M2 microglial cell dominance of four days. Forward predictions capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells and suggest a persistent inflammatory response. ",Kein DOI-Link verf端gbar,2404.10915v1,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0003-1371-147X,Andrea Arnold,"University of Vienna, University of Vienna  AT",Identification of Tissue Optical Properties During Thermal Laser-Tissue   Interactions: An Ensemble Kalman Filter-Based Approach,1970,"  In this paper, we propose a computational framework to estimate the physical properties that govern the thermal response of laser-irradiated tissue. We focus in particular on two quantities, the absorption and scattering coefficients, which describe the optical absorption of light in the tissue and whose knowledge is vital to correctly plan medical laser treatments. To perform the estimation, we utilize an implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a type of Bayesian filtering algorithm for data assimilation. Unlike prior approaches, in this work we estimate the tissue optical properties based on observations of the tissue thermal response to laser irradiation. This method has the potential for straightforward implementation in a clinical setup, as it would only require a simple thermal sensor, e.g., a miniaturized infrared camera. Because the optical properties of tissue can undergo shifts during laser exposure, we employ a variant of EnKF capable of tracking time-varying parameters. Through simulated experimental studies, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to identify the tissue optical properties and track their dynamic changes during laser exposure, while simultaneously tracking changes in the tissue temperature at locations beneath the surface. We further demonstrate the framework's capability in estimating additional unknown tissue properties (i.e., the volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity) along with the optical properties of interest.

0000-0003-1371-147X,Andrea Arnold,"University of Vienna, University of Vienna  AT",A data-informed mathematical model of microglial cell dynamics during   ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery,1970,"  Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes: M1, which can worsen brain injury; or M2, which can aid in long-term recovery. In this study, we contribute a summary of experimental data on microglial cell counts in the penumbra following ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and compile available data sets into a single set suitable for time series analysis. Further, we formulate a mathematical model of microglial cells in the penumbra during ischemic stroke due to MCAO. Through use of global sensitivity analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based parameter estimation, we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the number of M1 and M2 cells in the penumbra and fit identifiable parameters to the compiled experimental data set. We utilize results from MCMC parameter estimation to ascertain uncertainty bounds and forward predictions for the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells over time. Results demonstrate the significance of parameters related to M1 and M2 activation on the number of M1 and M2 microglial cells. Simulations further suggest that potential outliers in the observed data may be omitted and forecast predictions suggest a lingering inflammatory response.

0000-0003-1094-5641,Florian Gruber,"Medical University of Vienna, University of Vienna",Comparing topological charge definitions using topology fixing actions,1970,"  We investigate both the hyperbolic action and the determinant ratio action designed to fix the topological charge on the lattice. We show to what extent topology is fixed depending on the parameters of these actions, keeping the physical situation fixed. At the same time the agreement between different definitions of topological charge - the field theoretic and the index definition - is directly correlated to the degree topology is fixed. Moreover, it turns out that the two definitions agree very well. We also study finite volume effects arising in the static potential and related quantities due to topology fixing.

0000-0002-9142-8090,J旦rn Manz,Freie Universitaet Berlin,Maximum tunneling velocities in symmetric double well potentials,1970,"  We consider coherent tunneling of one-dimensional model systems in non-cyclic or cyclic symmetric double well potentials. Generic potentials are constructed which allow for analytical estimates of the quantum dynamics in the non-relativistic deep tunneling regime, in terms of the tunneling distance, barrier height and mass (or moment of inertia). For cyclic systems, the results may be scaled to agree well with periodic potentials for which semi-analytical results in terms of Mathieu functions exist. Starting from a wavepacket which is initially localized in one of the potential wells, the subsequent periodic tunneling is associated with tunneling velocities. These velocities (or angular velocities) are evaluated as the ratio of the flux densities versus the probability densities. The maximum velocities are found under the top of the barrier where they scale as the square root of the ratio of barrier height and mass (or moment of inertia), independent of the tunneling distance. They are applied exemplarily to several prototypical molecular models of non-cyclic and cyclic tunneling, including ammonia inversion, Cope rearrangment of semibullvalene, torsions of molecular fragments, and rotational tunneling in strong laser fields. Typical maximum velocities and angular velocities are in the order of a few km/s and from 10 to 100 THz for our non-cyclic and cyclic systems, respectively, much faster than time-averaged velocities. Even for the more extreme case of an electron tunneling through a barrier of height of one Hartree, the velocity is only about one percent of the speed of light. Estimates of the corresponding time scales for passing through {the narrow domain just} below the potential barrier are in the domain from 2 to 40 fs, much shorter than the tunneling times.
