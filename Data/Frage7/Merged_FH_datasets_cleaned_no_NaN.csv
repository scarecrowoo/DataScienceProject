0009-0002-6642-6904,Florian Adamsky,Hochschule Hof,Smartphones in a Microwave: Formal and Experimental Feasibility Study on   Fingerprinting the Corona-Warn-App,1970,"  Contact Tracing Apps (CTAs) have been developed to contain the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) spread. By design, such apps invade their users' privacy by recording data about their health, contacts, and partially location. Many CTAs frequently broadcast pseudorandom numbers via Bluetooth to detect encounters. These numbers are changed regularly to prevent individual smartphones from being trivially trackable. However, the effectiveness of this procedure has been little studied. We measured real smartphones and observed that the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA) exhibits a device-specific latency between two subsequent broadcasts. These timing differences provide a potential attack vector for fingerprinting smartphones by passively recording Bluetooth messages. This could conceivably lead to the tracking of users' trajectories and, ultimately, the re-identification of users. ",https://doi.org/10.1145/3600160.3605011,2307.02931v1,Yes,potent(1)

As well as enhancing clinical value, incorporation of simulation tools affords innovative avenues for open-ended, multi-disciplinary research collaboration. An extensible system for clinicians, technicians, manufacturers and researchers to build on a simulation framework is presented. This is achieved using a domain model that relates entities from theoretical, engineering and clinical domains, allowing algorithmic generation of simulation configuration for several open source solvers.   The platform is applied to Minimally Invasive Cancer Treatments (MICTs), allowing interventional radiologists to upload patient data, segment patient images and validate simulated treatments of radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation and irreversible electroporation. A traditional radiology software layout is provided in-browser for clinical use, with simple, guided simulation, primarily for training and research. Developers and manufacturers access a web-based system to manage their own simulation components (equipment, numerical models and clinical protocols) and related parameters.   This system is tested by interventional radiologists at four centres, using pseudonymized patient data, as part of the Go-Smart Project (http://gosmart-project.eu). The simulation technology is released as a set of open source components http://github.com/go-smart. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,1803.09166v1,Yes,innovative(1)
0000-0002-1440-1652,Michael Sterner,Regensburg Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,The impact of temporal hydrogen regulation on hydrogen exporters and   their domestic energy transition,1970,"  As global demand for green hydrogen rises, potential hydrogen exporters move into the spotlight. However, the large-scale installation of on-grid hydrogen electrolysis for export can have profound impacts on domestic energy prices and energy-related emissions. Our investigation explores the interplay of hydrogen exports, domestic energy transition and temporal hydrogen regulation, employing a sector-coupled energy model in Morocco. We find substantial co-benets of domestic climate change mitigation and hydrogen exports, whereby exports can reduce domestic electricity prices while mitigation reduces hydrogen export prices. However, increasing hydrogen exports quickly in a system that is still dominated by fossil fuels can substantially raise domestic electricity prices, if green hydrogen production is not regulated. Surprisingly, temporal matching of hydrogen production lowers domestic electricity cost by up to 31% while the effect on exporters is minimal. This policy instrument can steer the welfare (re-)distribution between hydrogen exporting firms, hydrogen importers, and domestic electricity consumers and hereby increases acceptance among actors.

Assessing surgical performance and efficiency, identifying skilled tool use and choreography, and planning operational and logistical aspects of OR resources are just a few of the applications that could benefit. Unfortunately, obtaining the annotations needed to train machine learning models to identify and localize surgical tools is a difficult task. Annotating bounding boxes frame-by-frame is tedious and time-consuming, yet large amounts of data with a wide variety of surgical tools and surgeries must be captured for robust training. Moreover, ongoing annotator training is needed to stay up to date with surgical instrument innovation. In robotic-assisted surgery, however, potentially informative data like timestamps of instrument installation and removal can be programmatically harvested. The ability to rely on tool installation data alone would significantly reduce the workload to train robust tool-tracking models. With this motivation in mind we invited the surgical data science community to participate in the challenge, SurgToolLoc 2022. The goal was to leverage tool presence data as weak labels for machine learning models trained to detect tools and localize them in video frames with bounding boxes. We present the results of this challenge along with many of the team's efforts. We conclude by discussing these results in the broader context of machine learning and surgical data science. The training data used for this challenge consisting of 24,695 video clips with tool presence labels is also being released publicly and can be accessed at https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/isi-surgtoolloc-2022.

We investigate how automation can improve documentation accuracy, alleviate clinician burnout, and enhance operational efficacy in healthcare facilities. This research was conducted within our participation in the Shared Task Discharge Me! at BioNLP @ ACL 2024. Various strategies were employed, including few-shot learning, instruction tuning, and Dynamic Expert Selection (DES), to develop models capable of generating the required text sections. Notably, utilizing an additional clinical domain-specific dataset demonstrated substantial potential to enhance clinical language processing. The DES method, which optimizes the selection of text outputs from multiple predictions, proved to be especially effective. It achieved the highest overall score of 0.332 in the competition, surpassing single-model outputs. This finding suggests that advanced deep learning methods in combination with DES can effectively automate parts of electronic health record documentation. These advancements could enhance patient care by freeing clinician time for patient interactions. The integration of text selection strategies represents a promising avenue for further research.

Particularly noteworthy is that this is not a classic attack on a quantum protocol. We describe an attack on the process of calibration. Results of the research show that quantum key distribution systems have vulnerabilities not only in the protocols, but also in other vital system components. The described type of attack does not affect the cryptographic strength of the received keys and does not point to the vulnerability of the quantum key distribution protocol. We also propose a method for autocompensating optical communication system development, which protects synchronization from unauthorized access. The proposed method is based on the use of sync pulses attenuated to a photon level in the process of detecting a time interval with a signal. The paper presents the results of experimental studies that show the discrepancies between the theoretical and real parameters of the system. The obtained data allow the length of the quantum channel to be calculated with high accuracy. ",https://doi.org/10.3390/e23050509,2104.13720v1,Yes,noteworthy(1)

Blockchain functions as an immutable record that enables decentralized transactions. Blockchain-based applications are sprouting up in a variety of industries, including financial services, reputation systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT), among others. However, many hurdles of blockchain technology, including scalability and security issues, have to be overcome. Many industries, including finance, medicine, manufacturing, and education, use blockchain applications to capitalize on this technology's unique set of properties. Blockchain technology (BT) has the potential to improve trustworthiness, collaboration, organization, identity, credibility, and transparency.

0000-0001-9143-2121,Maximilian Wolf,Hochschule Albstadt-Sigmaringen,Systematic Evaluation of Synthetic Data Augmentation for Multi-class   NetFlow Traffic,1970,"  The detection of cyber-attacks in computer networks is a crucial and ongoing research challenge. Machine learning-based attack classification offers a promising solution, as these models can be continuously updated with new data, enhancing the effectiveness of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike binary classification models that simply indicate the presence of an attack, multi-class models can identify specific types of attacks, allowing for more targeted and effective incident responses. However, a significant drawback of these classification models is their sensitivity to imbalanced training data. Recent advances suggest that generative models can assist in data augmentation, claiming to offer superior solutions for imbalanced datasets. Classical balancing methods, although less novel, also provide potential remedies for this issue. Despite these claims, a comprehensive comparison of these methods within the NIDS domain is lacking. Most existing studies focus narrowly on individual methods, making it difficult to compare results due to varying experimental setups. To close this gap, we designed a systematic framework to compare classical and generative resampling methods for class balancing across multiple popular classification models in the NIDS domain, evaluated on several NIDS benchmark datasets. Our experiments indicate that resampling methods for balancing training data do not reliably improve classification performance. Although some instances show performance improvements, the majority of results indicate decreased performance, with no consistent trend in favor of a specific resampling technique enhancing a particular classifier.

The critical temperature of pairing is shown to increase with the applied field strength. This is a new field effect and could contribute to the explanation of recent experiments on field induced superconductivity. From the field dependence of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the two--particle bound state solution is obtained as a resonance with a tunneling probability analogous to the WKB solution of a single particle confined in a potential and coupled to the electrical field.

0000-0003-2119-9461,Klaus Morawetz,FH Münster,On a correspondence between classical and quantum particle systems,1970,  An exact correspondence is established between a $N$-body classical interacting system and a $N-1$-body quantum system with respect to the partition function. The resulting quantum-potential is a $N-1$-body one. Inversely the Kelbg potential is reproduced which describes quantum systems at a quasi-classical level. The found correspondence between classical and quantum systems allows also to approximate dense classical many body systems by lower order quantum perturbation theory replacing Planck's constant properly by temperature and density dependent expressions. As an example the dynamical behaviour of an one - component plasma is well reproduced concerning the formation of correlation energy after a disturbance utilising solely the analytical quantum - Born result for dense degenerated Fermi systems. As a practical guide the quantum - Bruckner parameter $r_s$ has been replaced by the classical plasma parameter $\Gamma$ as $r_s\approx0.3 \Gamma^{3/2}$ ,https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.022103,physics/0011059v3,Yes,potent(2)
0000-0003-2119-9461,Klaus Morawetz,FH Münster,Exploring anomalies by many-body correlations,1970,"  The quantum anomaly can be written alternatively into a form violating conservation laws or as non-gauge invariant currents seen explicitly on the example of chiral anomaly. By reinterpreting the many-body averaging, the connection to Pauli-Villars regularization is established which gives the anomalous term a new interpretation as arising from quantum fluctuations by many-body correlations at short distances. This is exemplified by using an effective many-body quantum potential which realizes quantum Slater sums by classical calculations. It is shown that these quantum potentials avoid the quantum anomaly but approaches the same anomalous result by many-body correlations. A measure for the quality of quantum potentials is suggested to describe these quantum fluctuations in the mean energy. Consequently quantum anomalies might be a short-cut way of single-particle field theory to account for many-body effects. This conjecture is also supported since the chiral anomaly can be derived by a completely conserving quantum kinetic theory. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2004.01507v1,Yes,potent(3)

It is shown that this formation is much faster than dissipation due to collisions, in hot (dense) plasma the correlations form on the timescale of inverse plasma frequency (Fermi energy). This hierarchy of characteristic times is used to derive analytical formulae for time dependency of the potential energy of binary interactions which measures the extent of correlations. We discuss the dynamical formation of screening and compare with the statical screened result.Comparisons are made with molecular dynamic simulations. In the low temperature limit we find an analytical expression for the formation of correlation which is general for any binary interaction.

Numerical values of the off-shell contribution to the Wigner distribution, of the collision duration and of the collision nonlocality are presented for different realistic potentials.

0000-0003-2119-9461,Klaus Morawetz,FH Münster,Conditions where RPA becomes exact in the high-density limit,1970,"  It is shown that in $d$-dimensional systems, the vertex corrections beyond the random phase approximation (RPA) or GW approximation scales with the power $d-\beta-\alpha$ of the Fermi momentum if the relation between Fermi energy and Fermi momentum is $\epsilon_{\rm f}\sim p_{\rm f}^\beta$ and the interacting potential possesses a momentum-power-law of $\sim p^{-\alpha}$. The condition $d-\beta-\alpha<0$ specifies systems where RPA is exact in the high-density limit. The one-dimensional structure factor is found to be the interaction-free one in the high-density limit for contact interaction. A cancellation of RPA and vertex corrections render this result valid up to second-order in contact interaction. For finite-range potentials of cylindrical wires a large-scale cancellation appears and found to be independent of the width parameter of the wire.

One consequence of the correlated density is the Bernoulli potential in superconductors which compensates forces from dielectric currents.

Among the variety of potential applications hypericin can be used as photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT), where it is brought into cancer cells and produces singlet oxygen upon irradiation with a suitable light source.

Here, we present the first single molecule optical spectroscopy study of hypericin. Its photostability is large enough to obtain single molecule fluorescence, surface enhanced Raman spectra (SERS), fluorescence lifetime, antibunching and blinking dynamics. Embedding hypericin in a PVA matrix changes the blinking dynamics, reduces the fluorescence lifetime and increases the photostability.

This paper investigates the current state of risk management practices being used in information security management in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). We used an anonymous online survey targeting strategic and operative information security and risk managers and collected data from 26 organizations. We analyzed general practices, documentation artifacts, patterns of stakeholder collaboration as well as tool types and data sources used by enterprises to conduct information security management activities. Our findings show that the state of practice of information security risk management is in need of improvement. Current industrial practice heavily relies on manual data collection and complex potentially subjective decision processes with multiple stakeholders involved. Dedicated risk management tools and methods are used selectively and neglected in favor of general-purpose documentation tools and direct communication between stakeholders.

0000-0003-2310-5895,Dominik Merli,Augsburg Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,On the Security of IO-Link Wireless Communication in the Safety Domain,1970,"  Security is an essential requirement of Industrial Control System (ICS) environments and its underlying communication infrastructure. Especially the lowest communication level within Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems - the field level - commonly lacks security measures. Since emerging wireless technologies within field level expose the lowest communication infrastructure towards potential attackers, additional security measures above the prevalent concept of air-gapped communication must be considered. Therefore, this work analyzes security aspects for the wireless communication protocol IO-LinkWireless (IOLW), which is commonly used for sensor and actuator field level communication. A possible architecture for an IOLW safety layer has already been presented recently [1]. In this paper, the overall attack surface of IOLW within its typical environment is analyzed and attack preconditions are investigated to assess the effectiveness of different security measures. Additionally, enhanced security measures are evaluated for the communication systems and the results are summarized. Also, interference of security measures and functional safety principles within the communication are investigated, which do not necessarily complement one another but may also have contradictory requirements. This work is intended to discuss and propose enhancements of the IOLW standard with additional security considerations in future implementations. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2207.12938v3,Yes,potent(1)

In the present study, we expand upon the analysis of binary colloid mixtures and additionally introduce a third particle species to further our understanding of colloidal systems. Gravitationally driven, spherical colloids immersed in an implicit solvent are confined in two-dimensional linear microchannels. The interaction between the colloids is modeled by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential, and the confinement of the colloids is realized by hard walls based on the solution of the Smoluchowski equation in half space. In binary and ternary colloidal systems, a difference in the driving force is achieved by differing colloid sizes, but fixed mass density. We observe for both the binary and ternary systems that a driving force difference induces a nonequilibrium phase transition to lanes. For ternary systems, we study the tendency of lane formation in dependence of the diameter of the medium-sized colloids. Here, we find a sweetspot for lane formation in ternary systems. Furthermore, we study the interaction of two differently sized colloids at the channel walls. Recently, we observed that driven large colloids push smaller colloids to the walls. This results in small particle lanes at the walls at early simulation times. In this work, we additionally find that thin lanes are unstable and dissolve over very long time frames. Furthermore, we observe a connection between lane formation and the nonuniform distribution of particles along the channel length. This nonuniform distribution occurs either alongside lane formation or in shared lanes (i.e. lanes consisting of two colloid types).

At the heart of Youtopia is an update exchange abstraction: changes to the data propagate through the system to satisfy user-specified mappings. We present a novel change propagation model that combines a deterministic chase with human intervention. The process is fundamentally cooperative and gives users significant control over how mappings are repaired. An additional advantage of our model is that mapping cycles can be permitted without compromising correctness.   We investigate potential harmful interference between updates in our model; we introduce two appropriate notions of serializability that avoid such interference if enforced. The first is very general and related to classical final-state serializability; the second is more restrictive but highly practical and related to conflict-serializability. We present an algorithm to enforce the latter notion. Our algorithm is an optimistic one, and as such may sometimes require updates to be aborted. We develop techniques for reducing the number of aborts and we test these experimentally. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,0903.5346v1,Yes,potent(1)

The newest version features over 1000 qubits and was released in August 2015. We were given access to such a machine, currently hosted at NASA Ames Research Center in California, to explore the potential for hard optimization problems that arise in the context of databases.   In this paper, we tackle the problem of multiple query optimization (MQO). We show how an MQO problem instance can be transformed into a mathematical formula that complies with the restrictive input format accepted by the quantum annealer. This formula is translated into weights on and between qubits such that the configuration minimizing the input formula can be found via a process called adiabatic quantum annealing. We analyze the asymptotic growth rate of the number of required qubits in the MQO problem dimensions as the number of qubits is currently the main factor restricting applicability. We experimentally compare the performance of the quantum annealer against other MQO algorithms executed on a traditional computer. While the problem sizes that can be treated are currently limited, we already find a class of problem instances where the quantum annealer is three orders of magnitude faster than other approaches.

The goal is to find the set of Pareto plans realizing optimal cost tradeoffs for a given query. So far, only algorithms with exponential complexity in the number of query tables have been proposed for multi-objective query optimization. In this work, we present the first algorithm with polynomial complexity in the query size.   Our algorithm is randomized and iterative. It improves query plans via a multi-objective version of hill climbing that applies multiple transformations in each climbing step for maximal efficiency. Based on a locally optimal plan, we approximate the Pareto plan set within the restricted space of plans with similar join orders. We maintain a cache of Pareto-optimal plans for each potentially useful intermediate result to share partial plans that were discovered in different iterations. We show that each iteration of our algorithm performs in expected polynomial time based on an analysis of the expected path length between a random plan and local optima reached by hill climbing. We experimentally show that our algorithm can optimize queries with hundreds of tables and outperforms other randomized algorithms such as the NSGA-II genetic algorithm over a wide range of scenarios.

Such views have to be kept fresh at low maintenance cost and latencies. At the same time, these views have to support classical SQL, rather than window semantics, to enable applications that combine current with aged or historical data. In this paper, we present viewlet transforms, a recursive finite differencing technique applied to queries. The viewlet transform materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. The viewlet transform of a query admits efficient evaluation, the elimination of certain expensive query operations, and aggressive parallelization. We develop viewlet transforms into a workable query execution technique, present a heuristic and cost-based optimization framework, and report on experiments with a prototype dynamic data management system that combines viewlet transforms with an optimizing compilation technique. The system supports tens of thousands of complete view refreshes a second for a wide range of queries. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,1207.0137v1,Yes,fresh(2)

These problems are often solved with application-specific algorithms, even though their nature remains the same: mapping input image(s) to output image(s). Deep convolutional neural networks have shown great potential for highly variable tasks across many image-based domains, but are usually difficult to train due to their inner high non-linearities. We propose a novel neural network architecture highlighting fast convergence as a generic solution addressing image(s)-to-image(s) inverse problems of different domains. Here we show that this approach is effective at predicting phases from direct intensity measurements, imaging objects from diffused reflections and denoising scanning transmission electron microscopy images, with just different training datasets. This opens a way to solve problems statistically through big data, in contrast to implementing explicit inversion algorithms from their mathematical formulas. Previous works have targeted much more on \textit{how} can we reconstruct rather than \textit{what} can be reconstructed. Our strategy offers a paradigm shift.

We demonstrate that an above ground detector positioned right outside the IR-40 reactor building could meet and in some cases significantly exceed the verification goals identified by IAEA for plutonium production or diversion from declared inventories. In addition to monitoring the reactor during operation, observing antineutrino emissions from long-lived fission products could also allow monitoring the reactor when it is shutdown. Antineutrino monitoring could also be used to distinguish different levels of fuel enrichment. Most importantly, these capabilities would not require a complete reactor operational history and could provide a means to re-establish continuity of knowledge in safeguards conclusions should this become necessary.

However, their active control, e.g. as a response to electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large-scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, we show electrosorption-induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600 kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by electrical potential variations of approximately 1 V. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in-operando cyclic voltammetry and step-coulombmetry allow us to quantitatively trace this large electro-actuation to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross section and to determine the capacitive charge-stress coupling parameter upon ion ad- and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (electrostatic Hellmann-Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and pore-wall roughness on the single-nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo-mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer-scale, self-organized nanoporosity opens up entirely novel opportunities for on-chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation voltages.

In recent years, it has been shown that filling the pores with aqueous electrolytes in addition opens a particularly wide field for modifying and achieving active control of these functionalities, e.g., for electrochemo-mechanical actuation and tunable photonics, or for the design of on-chip supercapacitors. However, a mechanistic understanding of these new features has been hampered by the lack of a detailed characterization of the electrochemical behavior of mesoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes. Here, the capacitive, potential-controlled charging of the electrical double layer in a mesoporous silicon electrode (pore diameter $7\,\mathrm{nm}$) imbibed with perchloric acid solution is studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Thorough measurements with detailed explanations of the observed phenomena lead to a comprehensive understanding of the capacitive properties of porous silicon. An analysis based on the Mott-Schottky equation allows general conclusions to be drawn about the state of the band structure within the pore walls. Essential parameters such as the flat band potential, the doping density and the width of the space charge region can be determined. A comparison with bulk silicon shows that the flat band potential in particular is significantly altered by the introduction of nanopores, as it shifts from $1.4\pm0.1\,\mathrm{V}$ to $1.9\pm0.2\,\mathrm{V}$. Overall, this study provides a unique insight into the electrochemical processes, especially the electrical double layer charging, of nanoporous semiconductor electrodes.

Although the anapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral shape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\sim$ 10 tonne $\times$ year at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient statistics.

We point out, that oscillation itself strongly enhances the signal to noise ratio of a wrong sign muon search, provided there is sufficiently accurate neutrino energy reconstruction. Further, we argue that apart from a magnetic field, other means to distinguish neutrino from anti-neutrino events (at least statistically) can be explored. Combined with the fact that non-magnetic detectors potentially can be made very big, we show that modest neutrino/anti-neutrino separations at the level of 50% to 90% are sufficient to obtain good sensitivity to CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy for $\sin^22\theta_{13}>10^{-3}$. These non-magnetized detectors have a rich physics program outside the context of a neutrino factory, including topics like supernova neutrinos and proton decay.

Our approach overcomes recent limitations with extended narratives through a multi-layered computational approach to generate an abstract context representation. Therefore, the developed system captures the narrative on word-level, sentence-level, and context-level. Through the hierarchical set-up, our proposed model summarizes the most salient information on each level and creates an abstract representation of the extended context. We subsequently use this representation to enhance neural language processing systems on the task of semantic error detection. To show the potential of the newly introduced topology, we compare the approach against a context-agnostic set-up including a standard neural language model and a supervised binary classification network. The performance measures on the error detection task show the advantage of the hierarchical context-aware topologies, improving the baseline by 12.75% relative for unsupervised models and 20.37% relative for supervised models.

Despite its importance, one of the most prevailing limitations in modern day discourse parsing is the lack of large-scale datasets. To overcome the data sparsity issue, distantly supervised approaches from tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization have been recently proposed. Here, we extend this line of research by exploiting distant supervision from topic segmentation, which can arguably provide a strong and oftentimes complementary signal for high-level discourse structures. Experiments on two human-annotated discourse treebanks confirm that our proposal generates accurate tree structures on sentence and paragraph level, consistently outperforming previous distantly supervised models on the sentence-to-document task and occasionally reaching even higher scores on the sentence-to-paragraph level.

The imbibition kinetics are, however, solely determined by the static geometry of the porous host, the capillarity, and the fluidity of the imbibed liquid. This makes active control particularly challenging. Here, we show for aqueous electrolyte imbibition in nanoporous gold that the fluid flow can be reversibly switched on and off through electric potential control of the solid-liquid interfacial tension, i.e. we can accelerate the imbibition front, stop it, and have it proceed at will. Simultaneous measurements of the mass flux and the electrical current allow us to document simple scaling laws for the imbibition kinetics, and to explore the charge flow dynamics in the metallic nanopores. Our findings demonstrate that the high electric conductivity along with the pathways for ionic and/or fluid transport render nanoporous elemental gold a versatile, accurately controllable electro-capillary pump and flow sensor for minute amounts of liquids with exceptionally low operating voltages.

After discussing the sensitivity to theta_{13} and the leading atmospheric parameters, we demonstrate that leptonic CP violation will hardly be measurable without upgrades of the T2K and NOvA proton drivers, even if theta_{13} is large. In the presence of the proton drivers, the fast track to hints for CP violation requires communication between the T2K and NOvA collaborations in terms of a mutual synchronization of their neutrino-antineutrino run plans. Even in that case, upgrades will only discover CP violation in a relatively small part of the parameter space at the 3 sigma confidence level, while 90% confidence level hints will most likely be obtained.

We will demonstrate that such birefringence isotherms, when performed simultaneously with optically isotropic and index-matched counterparts (neopentane and hexafluoromethane), allow one to characterize the orientational state of the confined liquids with a high accuracy as a function of pore filling. The pore condensates are almost bulk-like, optically isotropic liquids. For both anisotropic species we find, however, a weak orientational order (of a few percent at maximum) upon film-condensation in the monolithic mesoporous membrane. It occurs upon formation of the second and third adsorbed layer, only, and vanishes gradually upon onset of capillary condensation. Presumably, it originates in the breaking of the full rotational symmetry of the interaction potential at the cylindrical, free liquid-vapor interface in the film-condensed state rather than at the silica-liquid interface.

We demonstrate that this approach carries more information than a conventional CP violation measurement, since it also describes the exclusion of parameter regions. This will be very useful for next-generation long baseline experiments where for sizable $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$ first constraints on $\delta_{CP}$ can be obtained. As the most sophisticated experimental setup, we analyze neutrino factories, where we illustrate the major difficulties in their analysis. In addition, we compare their potential to the one of superbeam upgrades and next-generation experiments, which also includes a discussion of synergy effects. We find a strong dependence on the yet unknown true values of $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$ and $\delta_{CP}$, as well as a strong, non-Gaussian dependence on the confidence level. A systematic understanding of the complicated parameter dependence will be given. In addition, it is shown that comparisons of experiments and synergy discussions do in general not allow for an unbiased judgment if they are only performed at selected points in parameter space. Therefore, we present our results in dependence of the yet unknown true values of $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$ and $\delta_{CP}$. Finally we show that for $\delta_{CP}$ precision measurements there exist simple strategies including superbeams, reactor experiments, superbeam upgrades, and neutrino factories, where the crucial discriminator is $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13} \sim 10^{-2}$.

The same property makes neutrinos challenging to detect in systems that would be practical for nuclear security applications. This colloquium presents a broad overview of several potential neutrino applications, including the near-field monitoring of known reactors, far-field monitoring of known or discovery of undeclared reactors, detection of reactor waste streams, and detection of nuclear explosions. We conclude that recent detector advances have made near-field monitoring feasible. Farther-field reactor detection and waste stream detection monitoring are possible in some cases with further research and development. Very long-range reactor monitoring and nuclear explosion detection do not appear feasible for the foreseeable future due to considerable physical and/or practical constraints.

Integrated electrical control of the silicon mechanics, however, would open up new perspectives for on-chip actuorics. Here, we combine wafer-scale nanoporosity in single-crystalline silicon with polymerization of an artificial muscle material inside pore space to synthesize a composite that shows macroscopic electrostrain in aqueous electrolyte. The voltage-strain coupling is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the best-performing ceramics in terms of piezoelectric actuation. We trace this huge electroactuation to the concerted action of 100 billions of nanopores per square centimetre cross-section and to potential-dependent pressures of up to 150 atmospheres at the single-pore scale. The exceptionally small operation voltages (0.4-0.9 V) along with the sustainable and biocompatible base materials make this hybrid promising for bio-actuator applications.

Using the potential of fixed window scans, i.e. scanning a sample parameter, while observing solely one specific energy transfer value, an overview of the dynamic landscape within a wide temperature range is obtained. It is shown that already these data provide a quite comprehensive understanding of the confinement-induced alteration of the molecular mobility in comparison to the bulk. A complementary, more detailed analysis of full energy transfer spectra at selected temperatures reveals two translational diffusive processes on different time scales. Both are considerably slower than in the bulk liquid and show a decrease of the respective self-diffusion coefficients with decreasing nanopore size. Different thermal activation energies for molecular self-diffusion in nanoporous carbons with similar pore size indicate the importance of pore morphology on the molecular mobility, beyond the pure degree of confinement. In spite of the dynamic slowing down we can show that the temperature range of the liquid state upon nanoconfinement is remarkably extended to much lower temperatures, which is beneficial for potential technical applications of such systems.

0000-0002-0669-5654,Patrick Huber,Kempten Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,Systematic uncertainties in long-baseline neutrino oscillations for   large $θ_{13}$,1970,"  We study the physics potential of future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments at large $\theta_{13}$, focusing especially on systematic uncertainties. We discuss superbeams, \bbeams, and neutrino factories, and for the first time compare these experiments on an equal footing with respect to systematic errors. We explicitly simulate near detectors for all experiments, we use the same implementation of systematic uncertainties for all experiments, and we fully correlate the uncertainties among detectors, oscillation channels, and beam polarizations as appropriate. As our primary performance indicator, we use the achievable precision in the measurement of the CP violating phase $\deltacp$. We find that a neutrino factory is the only instrument that can measure $\deltacp$ with a precision similar to that of its quark sector counterpart. All neutrino beams operating at peak energies $\gtrsim 2$ GeV are quite robust with respect to systematic uncertainties, whereas especially \bbeams and \thk suffer from large cross section uncertainties in the quasi-elastic regime, combined with their inability to measure the appearance signal cross sections at the near detector. A noteworthy exception is the combination of a $\gamma=100$ \bbeam with an \spl-based superbeam, in which all relevant cross sections can be measured in a self-consistent way. This provides a performance, second only to the neutrino factory. For other superbeam experiments such as \lbno and the setups studied in the context of the \lbne reconfiguration effort, statistics turns out to be the bottleneck. In almost all cases, the near detector is not critical to control systematics since the combined fit of appearance and disappearance data already constrains the impact of systematics to be small provided that the three active flavor oscillation framework is valid.

Based on the popular pre-training fine-tuning approach, we posit that an additional in-domain pre-training stage using a large-scale, natural, and diverse question-answering (QA) dataset can be beneficial for ODQA. Consequently, we propose a novel QA dataset based on the Common Crawl project in this paper. Using the readily available schema.org annotation, we extract around 130 million multilingual question-answer pairs, including about 60 million English data-points. With this previously unseen number of natural QA pairs, we pre-train popular language models to show the potential of large-scale in-domain pre-training for the task of question-answering. In our experiments, we find that pre-training question-answering models on our Common Crawl Question Answering dataset (CCQA) achieves promising results in zero-shot, low resource and fine-tuned settings across multiple tasks, models and benchmarks.

0000-0002-0669-5654,Patrick Huber,Kempten Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,CoDi: Conversational Distillation for Grounded Question Answering,1970,"  Distilling conversational skills into Small Language Models (SLMs) with approximately 1 billion parameters presents significant challenges. Firstly, SLMs have limited capacity in their model parameters to learn extensive knowledge compared to larger models. Secondly, high-quality conversational datasets are often scarce, small, and domain-specific. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data distillation framework named CoDi (short for Conversational Distillation, pronounced ""Cody""), allowing us to synthesize large-scale, assistant-style datasets in a steerable and diverse manner. Specifically, while our framework is task agnostic at its core, we explore and evaluate the potential of CoDi on the task of conversational grounded reasoning for question answering. This is a typical on-device scenario for specialist SLMs, allowing for open-domain model responses, without requiring the model to ""memorize"" world knowledge in its limited weights. Our evaluations show that SLMs trained with CoDi-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to models trained on human-annotated data in standard metrics. Additionally, when using our framework to generate larger datasets from web data, our models surpass larger, instruction-tuned models in zero-shot conversational grounded reasoning tasks.

0000-0002-0669-5654,Patrick Huber,Kempten Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,Small But Funny: A Feedback-Driven Approach to Humor Distillation,1970,"  The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to light promising language generation capabilities, particularly in performing tasks like complex reasoning and creative writing. Consequently, distillation through imitation of teacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from LLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well for simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring intricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We hypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be hard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving supplementary guidance from the teacher, could yield higher performance. To address this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a ""teacher"" generating data, as well as a ""critic"" evaluating the student's performance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation of feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their larger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation. As a result, our research highlights the potential of using feedback as an additional dimension to data when transferring complex language abilities via distillation.

Realizing such a hierarchical porosity in artificial materials necessitates often sophisticated and expensive top-down processing that limits scalability. Here we present an approach that combines self-organized porosity based on metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) with photolithographically induced macroporosity for the synthesis of single-crystalline silicon with a bimodal pore-size distribution, i.e., hexagonally arranged cylindrical macropores with 1 micrometer diameter separated by walls that are traversed by mesopores 60 nm across. The MACE process is mainly guided by a metal-catalyzed reduction-oxidation reaction, where silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) serve as the catalyst. In this process, the AgNPs act as self-propelled particles that are constantly removing silicon along their trajectories. High-resolution X-ray imaging and electron tomography reveal a resulting large open porosity and inner surface for potential applications in high-performance energy storage, harvesting and conversion or for on-chip sensorics and actuorics. Finally, the hierarchically porous silicon membranes can be transformed structure-conserving by thermal oxidation into hierarchically porous amorphous silica, a material that could be of particular interest for opto-fluidic and (bio-)photonic applications due to its multiscale artificial vascularization.

Experiments: Pure silica (SiO2) and amino-terminated silica (APTES-SiO2) NPs are compared to macroscopic surfaces with extremely low roughness (root mean square [RMS] roughness <= 2 nm) or a roughness determined by a close-packed layer of NPs (RMS roughness about 35 nm). Equivalence of the surface chemistry is assessed by comparing the electrokinetic potentials of the NPs via electrophoretic light scattering and of the macroscopic substrates via streaming current analysis. The wettability of the macroscopic substrates is obtained from advancing (ACAs) and receding contact angles (RCAs) and in situ synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) provided by the NP wettability at the liquid interfaces. Findings: Generally, the RCA on smooth surfaces provides a good estimate of NP wetting properties. However, mCAs alone cannot predict adsorption barriers that prevent NP segregation to the interface, as is the case with the pure SiO2 nanoparticles. This strategy greatly facilitates assessing the wetting properties of NPs for applications such as emulsion formulation, flotation, or water remediation.

However, the complexity of these networks, with their multidimensional interactions and decisions, presents significant challenges. This paper proposes FLEE-GNN, a novel Federated Learning System for Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network, designed to overcome these challenges and enhance the analysis of geospatial resilience of multicommodity food flow network, which is one type of spatial networks. FLEE-GNN addresses the limitations of current methodologies, such as entropy-based methods, in terms of generalizability, scalability, and data privacy.

Their optical functionality is not determined by the properties of the base materials, but rather by tailored, multiscale structures, in terms of precise pore shape, geometry, and orientation. Embedding liquid crystals in pore space provides additional opportunities to control light-matter interactions at the single-pore, meta-atomic scale. Here, we present temperature-dependent 3D reciprocal space mapping using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction in combination with high-resolution birefringence experiments on disk-like mesogens (HAT6) imbibed in self-ordered arrays of parallel cylindrical pores 17 to 160 nm across in monolithic anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). In agreement with Monte Carlo computer simulations we observe a remarkably rich self-assembly behaviour, unknown from the bulk state. It encompasses transitions between the isotropic liquid state and discotic stacking in linear columns as well as circular concentric ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis. These textural transitions underpin an optical birefringence functionality, tuneable in magnitude and in sign from positive to negative via pore size, pore surface-grafting and temperature. Our study demonstrates that the advent of large-scale, self-organised nanoporosity in monolithic solids along with confinement-controllable phase behaviour of liquid-crystalline matter at the single-pore scale provides a reliable and accessible tool to design materials with adjustable optical anisotropy, and thus offers versatile pathways to fine-tune polarisation-dependent light propagation speeds in materials. Such a tailorability is at the core of the emerging field of transformative optics, allowing, e.g., adjustable light absorbers and extremely thin metalenses.

Here, we report a study of the complex lattice dynamics of a SiO$_2$:KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocomposite consisting of a monolithic, mesoporous silica glass host with KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocrystals embedded in its tubular channels $\sim$12 nm across. A micro-Raman investigation performed in the spectral range of 70-1600 cm$^{-1}$ reveals the complex lattice dynamics of the confined crystals. Their Raman spectrum resembles the one taken from bulk KH$_2$PO$_4$ crystals and thus, along with X-ray diffraction experiments, corroborates the successful solution-based synthesis of KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocrystals with a structure analogous to the bulk material. We succeeded in observing not only the high-frequency internal modes ($\sim$900-1200 cm$^{-1}$), typical of internal vibrations of the PO$_4$ tetrahedra, but, more importantly, also the lowest frequency modes typical of bulk KH$_2$PO$_4$ crystals. The experimental Raman spectrum was interpreted with a group theory analysis and first-principle lattice dynamics calculations. The analysis of calculated eigen-vectors indicates the involvement of hydrogen atoms in most phonon modes corroborating the substantial significance of the hydrogen subsystem in the lattice dynamics of paraelectric bulk and of KH$_2$PO$_4$ crystals in extreme spatial confinement. A marginal redistribution of relative Raman intensities of the confined compared to unconfined crystals presumably originates in slightly changed crystal fields and interatomic interactions, in particular for the parts of the nanocrystals in close proximity to the silica pore surfaces.

Here, we demonstrate the tunability of strong gauge fields in non-local experiments using a large planar graphene sheet that conforms to the deformation of a piezoelectric layer by a surface acoustic wave. The acoustic wave induces a longitudinal and a giant synthetic Hall voltage in the absence of external magnetic fields. The superposition of a synthetic Hall potential and a conventional Hall voltage can annihilate the sample's transversal potential at large external magnetic fields. Surface acoustic waves thus provide a promising and facile avenue for the exploit of gauge fields in large planar graphene systems.

The measurements reveal the evolution of the microscopic structure of wetting films of the Bi-rich, low-surface-tension phase along different paths in the bulk phase diagram. A balance between the surface potential preferring the Bi-rich phase and the gravitational potential which favors the Ga-rich phase at the surface pins the interface of the two demixed liquid metallic phases close to the free surface. This enables us to resolve it on an Angstrom level and to apply a mean-field, square gradient model extended by thermally activated capillary waves as dominant thermal fluctuations. The sole free parameter of the gradient model, i.e. the so-called influence parameter, $\kappa$, is determined from our measurements. Relying on a calculation of the liquid/liquid interfacial tension that makes it possible to distinguish between intrinsic and capillary wave contributions to the interfacial structure we estimate that fluctuations affect the observed short-range, complete wetting phenomena only marginally. A critical wetting transition that should be sensitive to thermal fluctuations seems to be absent in this binary metallic alloy.

In this context we propose CoRT, a simple neural first-stage ranking model that leverages contextual representations from pretrained language models such as BERT to complement term-based ranking functions while causing no significant delay at query time.

By an exact mapping between $\delta$-potentials and boundary conditions on the few-body wave functions, we are able to extend previous semiclassical results for single-particle systems with mixed boundary conditions to the two-body problem. The semiclassical approach allows us to derive explicit analytical results for the smooth part of the two-body density of states that are in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. It further enables us to include the effect of bound states in the attractive case. Remarkably, for the particular case of two particles in one dimension, the discrete energy levels obtained through a requantization condition of the smooth density of states are essentially in perfect agreement with the exact ones.

We report here for the first time on novel strategies for handling data-intensive vibration testings to gain better insights into friction brake system vibrations and noise generation mechanisms. Machine learning-based methods to detect and characterize vibrations, to understand sensitivities and to predict brake squeal are applied with the aim to illustrate how interdisciplinary approaches can leverage the potential of data science techniques for classical mechanical engineering challenges. In the first part, a deep learning brake squeal detector is developed to identify several classes of typical friction noise recordings. The detection method is rooted in recent computer vision techniques for object detection based on convolutional neural networks. It allows to overcome limitations of classical approaches that solely rely on instantaneous spectral properties of the recorded noise. Results indicate superior detection and characterization quality when compared to a state-of-the-art brake squeal detector. In the second part, a recurrent neural network is employed to learn the parametric patterns that determine the dynamic stability of an operating brake system. Given a set of multivariate loading conditions, the RNN learns to predict the noise generation of the structure. The validated RNN represents a virtual twin model for the squeal behavior of a specific brake system. It is found that this model can predict the occurrence and the onset of brake squeal with high accuracy and that it can identify the complicated patterns and temporal dependencies in the loading conditions that drive the dynamical structure into regimes of instability.

To this end we first study numerically how the non-interacting basis is coupled by the interaction. Our results indicate that the typical coupling matrix element decreases significantly faster with increasing single-particle localization length than is assumed in the random matrix model. We further show that even for models where the dependency of the coupling matrix element on the single-particle localization length is correctly described by the corresponding random matrix model its predictions for the localization length can be qualitatively incorrect. These results indicate that the mapping of an interacting random system onto an effective random matrix model is potentially dangerous.

It was recently shown that these topologically disordered lattices feature strong disorder anticorrelations between the coordination numbers that qualitatively change the properties of continuous and first-order phase transitions. To determine whether or not these unusual features also influence Anderson localization, we study the electronic wave functions by multifractal analysis and finite-size scaling. We observe only localized states for all energies in the two-dimensional system. In three dimensions, we find two Anderson transitions between localized and extended states very close to the band edges. The critical exponent of the localization length is about 1.6. All these results agree with the usual orthogonal universality class. Additional generic energetic randomness introduced via random potentials does not lead to qualitative changes but allows us to obtain a phase diagram by varying the strength of these potentials.

0000-0001-9643-7407,Johannes Lange,München Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,Cluster Cosmology Without Cluster Finding,1970,"  We propose that observations of super-massive galaxies contain cosmological constraining power similar to conventional cluster cosmology, and we provide promising indications that the associated systematic errors are comparably easier to control. We consider a fiducial spectroscopic and stellar mass complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) and forecast how constraints on Omega_m-sigma_8 from this sample will compare with those from number counts of clusters based on richness. At fixed number density, we find that massive galaxies offer similar constraints to galaxy clusters. However, a mass-complete galaxy sample from DESI has the potential to probe lower halo masses than standard optical cluster samples (which are typically limited to richness above 20 and halo mass above 10^13.5); additionally, it is straightforward to cleanly measure projected galaxy clustering for such a DESI sample, which we show can substantially improve the constraining power on Omega_m. We also compare the constraining power of stellar mass-limited samples to those from larger but mass-incomplete samples (e.g., the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, BGS, Sample); relative to a lower number density stellar mass-limited samples, we find that a BGS-like sample improves statistical constraints by 60% for Omega_m and 40% for sigma_8, but this uses small scale information which will be harder to model for BGS. Our initial assessment of the systematics associated with supermassive galaxy cosmology yields promising results. The proposed samples have a 10% satellite fraction, but we show that cosmological constraints may be robust to the impact of satellites. These findings motivate future work to realize the potential of super-massive galaxies to probe lower halo masses than richness-based clusters and to avoid persistent systematics associated with optical cluster finding.

We consider galaxies with $\log {M_{\star}/M_{\odot}}>11.5$ at 0.2 < z < 0.5 with carefully measured light profiles and clusters from the redMaPPer and CAMIRA richness-based algorithms. We devise a method (the ""TopN"" test) to evaluate the scatter in the halo mass-observable relation for different tracers and inter-compare halo mass proxies in four number density bins using stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. This test reveals three key findings. The stellar mass based on cModel photometry or aperture luminosity within R<30 kpc is a poor proxy of halo mass. In contrast, the stellar mass of the outer envelope is an excellent halo mass proxy. The stellar mass within R=[50,100] kpc, M*[50,100], has performance comparable to the state-of-the-art richness-based cluster finders at $\log{M_{\rm vir}/M_{\odot}}>14.0$ and could be a better halo mass tracer at lower halo masses. Finally, using N-body simulations, we find that the lensing profiles of massive halos selected by M*[50,100] are consistent with the expectation for a sample without projection or mis-centering effects. On the other hand, Richness-selected clusters display an excess at R~1 Mpc in their lensing profiles, which may suggest a more significant impact from selection biases. These results suggest that Mstar-based tracers have distinct advantages in identifying massive halos, which could open up new avenues for cluster cosmology.

Social bots are assumed to be automated social media accounts operated by malicious actors with the goal of manipulating public opinion. They are credited with the ability to produce content autonomously and to interact with human users. Social bot activity has been reported in many different political contexts, including the U.S. presidential elections, discussions about migration, climate change, and COVID-19. However, the relevant publications either use crude and questionable heuristics to discriminate between supposed social bots and humans or -- in the vast majority of the cases -- fully rely on the output of automatic bot detection tools, most commonly Botometer. In this paper, we point out a fundamental theoretical flaw in the widely-used study design for estimating the prevalence of social bots. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the validity of peer-reviewed Botometer-based studies by closely and systematically inspecting hundreds of accounts that had been counted as social bots. We were unable to find a single social bot. Instead, we found mostly accounts undoubtedly operated by human users, the vast majority of them using Twitter in an inconspicuous and unremarkable fashion without the slightest traces of automation. We conclude that studies claiming to investigate the prevalence, properties, or influence of social bots based on Botometer have, in reality, just investigated false positives and artifacts of this approach.

To operate the dots, e.g., as qubits, a precise understanding and control of the confined states and their properties is required. Herein, a large-scale numerical characterization of confined quantum states in bilayer graphene dots is performed over an extensive range of gate-tunable parameters such as the dot size, depth, shape, and the bilayer graphene gap. The dot states' orbital degeneracy, wave function distribution, and valley g-factor are established and the parametric dependencies to achieve different regimes are provided. It is found that the dot states are highly susceptible to gate-dependent confinement and material parameters, enabling efficient tuning of confined states and valley g-factor modulation by quantum dot design.

We directly observe the charge motion at a specific site in an electronically excited molecule using time-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TR-XPS). We extend the concept of static chemical shift from conventional XPS by the excited-state chemical shift (ESCS), which is connected to the charge in the framework of a potential model. This allows us to invert TR-XPS spectra to the dynamic charge at a specific atom. We demonstrate the power of TR-XPS by using sulphur 2p-core-electron-emission probing to study the UV-excited dynamics of 2-thiouracil. The new method allows us to discover that a major part of the population relaxes to the molecular ground state within 220-250 fs. In addition, a 250-fs oscillation, visible in the kinetic energy of the TR-XPS, reveals a coherent exchange of population among electronic states.

During crises, organisations such as the World Food Programme use remotely sensed imagery, typically obtained through drones, for rapid situational analysis to plan life-saving actions. Computer Vision tools are needed to support task force experts on-site in the evaluation of the imagery to improve their efficiency and to allocate resources strategically. We introduce the BlessemFlood21 dataset to stimulate research on efficient flood detection tools. The imagery was acquired during the 2021 Erftstadt-Blessem flooding event and consists of high-resolution and georeferenced RGB-NIR images. In the resulting RGB dataset, the images are supplemented with detailed water masks, obtained via a semi-supervised human-in-the-loop technique, where in particular the NIR information is leveraged to classify pixels as either water or non-water. We evaluate our dataset by training and testing established Deep Learning models for semantic segmentation. With BlessemFlood21 we provide labeled high-resolution RGB data and a baseline for further development of algorithmic solutions tailored to flood detection in RGB imagery.

Depth profiles of the local binding energies for the core levels are obtained by measuring the photoemission spectra at different incident photon energies between 3 and 7 keV and analyzing them with simple numerical models.

The less well-known sub-class of porphyrin diacids has been used in this work to construct an ionic hybrid organic-inorganic material in combination with a halogenidometalate anion. The resulting compound, $[H_6TPyP][BiCl_6]_2$ (1) (TPyP = tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin) has been obtained via a facile solution based synthesis in single crystalline form. The material exhibits a broad photoluminescence emission band between 650 and 850 nm at room temperature. Single crystals of $[H_6TPyP][BiCl_6]_2$ show a photocurrent in the fA and a much higher dark current in the nA range. They also display an unexpected reversible color change upon wetting with different liquids. This phenomenon has been investigated with optical spectroscopy, SEM, XPS and NEXAFS techniques, showing that a surface-based structural coloration effect is the source of the color change. This stands in contrast to other materials where structural coloration typically has to be introduced through elaborate, multi-step processes or the use of natural templates. Additionally, it underscores the potential of self-assembly of porphyrinic hybrid compounds in the fabrication of materials with unusual optical properties.

Software startups are quite distinct from traditional mature software companies, but also from micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, introducing new challenges relevant for software engineering research. This paper's research agenda focuses on software engineering in startups, identifying, in particular, 70+ research questions in the areas of supporting startup engineering activities, startup evolution models and patterns, ecosystems and innovation hubs, human aspects in software startups, applying startup concepts in non-startup environments, and methodologies and theories for startup research. We connect and motivate this research agenda with past studies in software startup research, while pointing out possible future directions. While all authors of this research agenda have their main background in Software Engineering or Computer Science, their interest in software startups broadens the perspective to the challenges, but also to the opportunities that emerge from multi-disciplinary research. Our audience is therefore primarily software engineering researchers, even though we aim at stimulating collaborations and research that crosses disciplinary boundaries.

However, applying them to industrial prediction problems is challenging as it is not immediately clear how to define and access appropriate concepts for individual use cases and specific data types. In this work, we investigate how to leverage established concept-based explanation techniques in the context of bearing fault detection with deep neural networks trained on vibration signals. Since bearings are prevalent in almost every rotating equipment, ensuring the reliability of intransparent fault detection models is crucial to prevent costly repairs and downtimes of industrial machinery. Our evaluations demonstrate that explaining opaque models in terms of vibration concepts enables human-comprehensible and intuitive insights about their inner workings, but the underlying assumptions need to be carefully validated first.

However, current monitoring methods lack the capability of provide actionable insights answering the question of why the performance of a particular model really degraded. In this work, we propose a novel approach to explain the behavior of a black-box model under feature shifts by attributing an estimated performance change to interpretable input characteristics. We refer to our method that combines concepts from Optimal Transport and Shapley Values as Explanatory Performance Estimation (XPE). We analyze the underlying assumptions and demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several baselines on different data sets across various data modalities such as images, audio, and tabular data. We also indicate how the generated results can lead to valuable insights, enabling explanatory model monitoring by revealing potential root causes for model deterioration and guiding toward actionable countermeasures.

This scheme is based on representation theory of groups and methods to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations. We extend this scheme in such a way that the measurement is minimally disturbing, i.e., it changes the state vector \ket{\Psi} of the system to \sqrt{\Pi} \ket{\Psi} where \Pi is the positive operator corresponding to the measured result.   Using this method, we construct quantum circuits for measurements with Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry. A continuous generalization leads to a scheme for optimal simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a Schr""odinger particle moving in one dimension such that the outcomes satisfy \Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar.   The particle to be measured collides with two probe particles, one for the position and the other for the momentum measurement. The position and momentum resolution can be tuned by the entangled joint state of the probe particles which is also generated by a collision with hard-core potential. The parameters of the POVM can then be controlled by the initial widths of the wave functions of the probe particles. We point out some formal similarities and differences to simultaneous measurements of quadrature amplitudes in quantum optics. ",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2222080,quant-ph/0507097v2,Yes,potent(1)

Our findings are based on an extensive series of interviews regarding the role and applicability of XAI along the Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle in current industrial practice and its expected relevance in the future.

On top of that, we outline the state of XAI research by providing a concise review of the relevant literature. This enables us to provide an encompassing overview covering the opinions of the surveyed persons as well as the current state of academic research. By comparing our interview results with the current research approaches we reveal several discrepancies. While a multitude of different XAI approaches exists, most of them are centered around the model evaluation phase and data scientists. Their versatile capabilities for other stages are currently either not sufficiently explored or not popular among practitioners. In line with existing work, our findings also confirm that more efforts are needed to enable also non-expert users' interpretation and understanding of opaque AI models with existing methods and frameworks.

0000-0001-6485-330X,Mario Goldenbaum,Bremen Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften,Robust Analog Function Computation via Wireless Multiple-Access Channels,1970,"  Various wireless sensor network applications involve the computation of a pre-defined function of the measurements without the need for reconstructing each individual sensor reading. Widely-considered examples of such functions include the arithmetic mean and the maximum value. Standard approaches to the computation problem separate computation from communication: quantized sensor readings are transmitted interference-free to a fusion center that reconstructs each sensor reading and subsequently computes the sought function value. Such separation-based computation schemes are generally highly inefficient as a complete reconstruction of individual sensor readings is not necessary for the fusion center to compute a function of them. In particular, if the mathematical structure of the wireless channel is suitably matched (in some sense) to the function, then channel collisions induced by concurrent transmissions of different nodes can be beneficially exploited for computation purposes. Therefore, in this paper a practically relevant analog computation scheme is proposed that allows for an efficient estimate of linear and nonlinear functions over the wireless multiple-access channel. After analyzing the asymptotic properties of the estimation error, numerical simulations are presented to show the potential for huge performance gains when compared with time-division multiple-access based computation schemes.

These new algorithms must then be integrated into existing protocols, applications and infrastructures.

To illustrate incompatibilities, we integrate two different PQC algorithms into two different existing software products (the InboxPager email client for the Android OS and the TLS implementation of the Bouncy Castle crypto library). Here, we rely on the highly-abstract crypto library eUCRITE, which hides technical details about the correct usage of classical and PCQ algorithms and thus prevents some potential implementation errors.

Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior.   Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data.   Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data.   Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2401.00275v2,Yes,potent(1)

Due to various privacy issues in the acquisition of images containing tattoos, only a limited number of databases exists. This lack of databases has delayed the development of new methods to effectively retrieve a potential suspect's tattoo images from a candidate gallery. To mitigate this issue, in our work, we use an unsupervised generative approach to create a balanced database consisting of 28,550 semi-synthetic images with tattooed subjects from 571 tattoo categories. Further, we introduce a novel Tattoo Template Reconstruction Network (TattTRN), which learns to map the input tattoo sample to its respective tattoo template to enhance the distinguishing attributes of the final feature embedding.

Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review -- a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review -- manuscripts, reviews, discussions -- are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.

One method to solve reinforcement learning tasks is Neuroevolution, where neural networks are optimized by evolutionary algorithms. A disadvantage of Neuroevolution is that it can require numerous function evaluations, while not fully utilizing the available information from each fitness evaluation. This is especially problematic when fitness evaluations become expensive. To reduce the cost of fitness evaluations, surrogate models can be employed to partially replace the fitness function. The difficulty of surrogate modeling for Neuroevolution is the complex search space and how to compare different networks. To that end, recent studies showed that a kernel based approach, particular with phenotypic distance measures, works well. These kernels compare different networks via their behavior (phenotype) rather than their topology or encoding (genotype). In this work, we discuss the use of surrogate model-based Neuroevolution (SMB-NE) using a phenotypic distance for reinforcement learning. In detail, we investigate a) the potential of SMB-NE with respect to evaluation efficiency and b) how to select adequate input sets for the phenotypic distance measure in a reinforcement learning problem. The results indicate that we are able to considerably increase the evaluation efficiency using dynamic input sets. ",https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321829,1907.09300v1,Yes,potent(1)

The implementation of security measures such as anonymization is thus needed to protect individuals' privacy. Often, a trade-off arises as such techniques potentially decrease the utility of the data and limit its use. While much research on anonymization techniques exists, there is little information on the actual implementations by practitioners, especially outside the big tech context. Within our study, we conducted expert interviews to gain insights into practices in the field. We categorize purposes, data sources, analysis, and modeling tasks to provide a profound understanding of the context such data is used in.

These models aim to facilitate the sharing of data while safeguarding privacy, all while ensuring high utility and flexibility regarding potential applications. However, current utility evaluation methods fail to fully account for real-life requirements. We evaluate the utility of five state-of-the-art synthesis approaches, each with and without the incorporation of differential privacy (DP) guarantees, in terms of real-world applicability. Specifically, we focus on so-called trip data that encode fine granular urban movements such as GPS-tracked taxi rides. Such data prove particularly valuable for downstream tasks at the road network level. Thus, our initial step involves appropriately map matching the synthetic data and subsequently comparing the resulting trips with those generated by the routing algorithm implemented in OpenStreetMap, which serves as an efficient and privacy-friendly baseline. Out of the five evaluated models, one fails to produce data within reasonable computation time and another generates too many jumps to meet the requirements for map matching. The remaining three models succeed to a certain degree in maintaining spatial distribution, one even with DP guarantees. However, all models struggle to produce meaningful sequences of geo-locations with reasonable trip lengths and to model traffic flow at intersections accurately. It is important to note that trip data encompasses various relevant characteristics beyond spatial distribution, such as temporal information, all of which are discarded by these models. Consequently, our results imply that current synthesis models fall short in their promise of high utility and flexibility. ",https://doi.org/10.1145/3589132.36256,2407.03237v1,Yes,potent(1)
0000-0002-8348-8958,Alexandra Kapp,"Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin, Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften",Towards Standardized Mobility Reports with User-Level Privacy,1970,"  The importance of human mobility analyses is growing in both research and practice, especially as applications for urban planning and mobility rely on them. Aggregate statistics and visualizations play an essential role as building blocks of data explorations and summary reports, the latter being increasingly released to third parties such as municipal administrations or in the context of citizen participation. However, such explorations already pose a threat to privacy as they reveal potentially sensitive location information, and thus should not be shared without further privacy measures.   There is a substantial gap between state-of-the-art research on privacy methods and their utilization in practice. We thus conceptualize a standardized mobility report with differential privacy guarantees and implement it as open-source software to enable a privacy-preserving exploration of key aspects of mobility data in an easily accessible way. Moreover, we evaluate the benefits of limiting user contributions using three data sets relevant to research and practice. Our results show that even a strong limit on user contribution alters the original geospatial distribution only within a comparatively small range, while significantly reducing the error introduced by adding noise to achieve privacy guarantees.

Industry and society are expected to benefit from these functionalities. For instance, robot programmers will no longer travel worldwide to plan and test robot motions, even collaboratively. Instead, they will have a personalized access to robots and their environments from anywhere, thus spending more time with family and friends. Students enrolled in robotics courses will be taught under authentic industrial conditions in real-time. This paper describes objectives of Metarobotics in society, industry, and in-between. It identifies and surveys technologies likely to enable their completion and provides an architecture to put forward the interplay of key components of Metarobotics. Potentials for self-determination, self-efficacy, and work-life-flexibility in robotics-related applications in Society 5.0, Industry 4.0, and Industry 5.0 are outlined.

These robots are often designed to consider a single sequence of mission events, with complex algorithms lowering individual subtask failure rates under some critical constraints. Our approach utilizes common techniques in vision and control, and encodes robustness into mission structure through outcome monitoring and recovery strategies. In addition, our system infrastructure enables rapid deployment and requires no central communication. This report also includes lessons in rapid field robotic development and testing. We developed and evaluated our systems through real-robot experiments at an outdoor test site in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, as well as in the 2020 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge. All competition trials were completed in fully autonomous mode without RTK-GPS. Our system placed fourth in Challenge 2 and seventh in the Grand Challenge, with notable achievements such as popping five balloons (Challenge 1), successfully picking and placing a block (Challenge 2), and dispensing the most water onto an outdoor, real fire with an autonomous UAV (Challenge 3).

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Guaranteed Parameter Estimation for Discrete Energy Minimization,1970,"  Structural learning, a method to estimate the parameters for discrete energy minimization, has been proven to be effective in solving computer vision problems, especially in 3D scene parsing. As the complexity of the models increases, structural learning algorithms turn to approximate inference to retain tractability. Unfortunately, such methods often fail because the approximation can be arbitrarily poor. In this work, we propose a method to overcome this limitation through exploiting the properties of the joint problem of training time inference and learning. With the help of the learning framework, we transform the inapproximable inference problem into a polynomial time solvable one, thereby enabling tractable exact inference while still allowing an arbitrary graph structure and full potential interactions. Our learning algorithm is guaranteed to return a solution with a bounded error to the global optimal within the feasible parameter space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on two point cloud scene parsing datasets. Our approach runs much faster and solves a problem that is intractable for previous, well-known approaches.

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Slow Cooling and Fast Reinflation for Hot Jupiters,1970,"  The unexpectedly large radii of hot Jupiters are a longstanding mystery whose solution will provide important insights into their interior physics. Many potential solutions have been suggested, which make diverse predictions about the details of inflation. In particular, although any valid model must allow for maintaining large planetary radii, only some allow for radii to increase with time. This reinflation process would potentially occur when the incident flux on the planet is increased. In this work, we examine the observed population of hot Jupiters to see if they grow as their parent stars brighten along the main sequence. We consider the relation between radius and other observables, including mass, incident flux, age, and fractional age (age over main sequence lifetime), and show that main sequence brightening is often sufficient to produce detectable reinflation. We further argue that these provide strong evidence for the relatively rapid reinflation of giant planets, and discuss the implications for proposed heating mechanisms. In our population analysis we also find evidence for a ""delayed-cooling effect"", wherein planets cool and contract far more slowly than expected. While not capable of explaining the observed radii alone, it may represent an important component of the effect. Finally, we identify a weak negative relationship between stellar metallicity and planet radius which is presumably the result of enhanced planetary bulk metallicity around metal-rich stars and has important implications for planet formation theory.

We used isochrone fitting and $Gaia$ DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and spectrophotometric metallicities to compute precise, homogeneous $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, masses, radii, mean stellar densities, luminosities, ages, distances, and V-band extinctions for 3248, 565, and 4180 $Kepler$, $K2$, and $TESS$ stars, respectively. We compared our stellar properties to studies using fundamental and precise constraints, such as interferometry and asteroseismology, and find residual scatters of 2.8%, 5.6%, 5.0%, and 31%, with offsets of 0.2%, 1.0%, 1.2%, and 0.7% between our $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, radii, masses, and ages and those in the literature, respectively. In addition, we compute planet radii, semimajor axes, and incident fluxes for 4281, 676, and 4367 $Kepler$, $K2$, and $TESS$ planets, respectively, and find that the exoplanet radius gap is less prominent in the $K2$, $TESS$, and combined samples than it is in the $Kepler$ sample alone. We suspect this difference is largely due to heterogeneous planet-to-star radius ratios, shorter time baselines of $K2$ and $TESS$, and smaller sample sizes. Finally, we identify a clear radius inflation trend in our large sample of hot Jupiters and find 150 hot sub-Neptunian desert planets, in addition to a population of over 400 young host stars as potential opportunities for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Data-driven derivation of stellar properties from photometric time   series data using convolutional neural networks,1970,"  Stellar variability is driven by a multitude of internal physical processes that depend on fundamental stellar properties. These properties are our bridge to reconciling stellar observations with stellar physics, and for understanding the distribution of stellar populations within the context of galaxy formation. Numerous ongoing and upcoming missions are charting brightness fluctuations of stars over time, which encode information about physical processes such as rotation period, evolutionary state (such as effective temperature and surface gravity), and mass (via asteroseismic parameters). Here, we explore how well we can predict these stellar properties, across different evolutionary states, using only photometric time series data. To do this, we implement a convolutional neural network, and with data-driven modeling we predict stellar properties from light curves of various baselines and cadences. Based on a single quarter of \textit{Kepler} data, we recover stellar properties, including surface gravity for red giant stars (with an uncertainty of $\lesssim$ 0.06 dex), and rotation period for main sequence stars (with an uncertainty of $\lesssim$ 5.2 days, and unbiased from $\approx$5 to 40 days). Shortening the \textit{Kepler} data to a 27-day TESS-like baseline, we recover stellar properties with a small decrease in precision, $\sim$0.07 dex for log $g$ and $\sim$5.5 days for $P_{\rm rot}$, unbiased from $\approx$5 to 35 days. Our flexible data-driven approach leverages the full information content of the data, requires minimal feature engineering, and can be generalized to other surveys and datasets. This has the potential to provide stellar property estimates for many millions of stars in current and future surveys. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2005.09682v1,Yes,potent(1)
0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Evidence that Core-Powered Mass-Loss Dominates Over Photoevaporation in   Shaping the Kepler Radius Valley,1970,"  The dearth of planets with sizes around 1.8 $\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ is a key demographic feature discovered by the $Kepler$ mission. Two theories have emerged as potential explanations for this valley: photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss. However, Rogers et al. (2021) shows that differentiating between the two theories is possible using the three-dimensional parameter space of planet radius, incident flux, and stellar mass. We use homogeneously-derived stellar and planetary parameters to measure the $Kepler$ exoplanet radius gap in this three-dimensional space. We compute the slope of the gap as a function of incident flux at constant stellar mass ($\alpha$ $\equiv$ $\left(\partial \log R_{\mathrm{gap}} / \partial \log S \right)_{M_\star}$) and the slope of the gap as a function of stellar mass at constant incident flux ($\beta$ $\equiv$ $\left(\partial \log R_{\mathrm{gap}} / \partial \log M_\star \right)_{S}$) and find $\alpha$ = 0.069$^{+0.019}_{-0.023}$ and $\beta$ = $-$0.046$^{+0.125}_{-0.117}$. Given that Rogers et al. (2021) shows that core-powered mass-loss predicts $\alpha$ $\approx$ 0.08 and $\beta$ $\approx$ 0.00 while photoevaporation predicts $\alpha$ $\approx$ 0.12 and $\beta$ $\approx$ --0.17, our measurements are more consistent with core-powered mass-loss than photoevaporation. However, we caution that different gap-determination methods can produce systematic offsets in both $\alpha$ and $\beta$; therefore, we motivate a comprehensive re-analysis of $Kepler$ light curves with modern, updated priors on eccentricity and mean stellar density to improve both the accuracy and precision of planet radii and subsequent measurements of the gap.

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Highly indistinguishable and strongly entangled photons from symmetric   GaAs quantum dots,1970,"  The development of scalable sources of non-classical light is fundamental to unlock the technological potential of quantum photonics\cite{Kimble:Nat2008}. Among the systems under investigation, semiconductor quantum dots are currently emerging as near-optimal sources of indistinguishable single photons. However, their performances as sources of entangled-photon pairs are in comparison still modest. Experiments on conventional Stranski-Krastanow InGaAs quantum dots have reported non-optimal levels of entanglement and indistinguishability of the emitted photons. For applications such as entanglement teleportation and quantum repeaters, both criteria have to be met simultaneously. In this work, we show that this is possible focusing on a system that has received limited attention so far: GaAs quantum dots grown via droplet etching. Using a two-photon resonant excitation scheme, we demonstrate that these quantum dots can emit triggered polarization-entangled photons with high purity (g^(2)(0)=0.002 +/-0.002), high indistinguishability (0.93 +/-0.07) and high entanglement fidelity (0.94 +/-0.01). Such unprecedented degree of entanglement, which in contrast to InGaAs can theoretically reach near-unity values, allows Bell's inequality (2.64 +/-0.01) to be violated without the aid of temporal or spectral filtering. Our results show that if quantum-dot entanglement resources are to be used for future quantum technologies, GaAs might be the system of choice.

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Revised Radii of Kepler Stars and Planets Using Gaia Data Release 2,1970,"  One bottleneck for the exploitation of data from the $Kepler$ mission for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research has been the lack of precise radii and evolutionary states for most of the observed stars. We report revised radii of 177,911 $Kepler$ stars derived by combining parallaxes from $Gaia$ Data Release 2 with the DR25 $Kepler$ Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is $\approx$ 8%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4-5 over previous estimates for typical $Kepler$ stars. We find that $\approx$ 67% ($\approx$ 120,000) of all $Kepler$ targets are main-sequence stars, $\approx$ 21% ($\approx$ 37,000) are subgiants, and $\approx$ 12% ($\approx$ 21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes $>$ 200$F_\oplus$ and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to $\approx$ 2$R_\oplus$) when compared to previous results. Further, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously-described ""hot super-Earth desert"" at high irradiance, show the relation between gas-giant planet radius and incident flux, and establish a bona-fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ $<$ 2$R_\oplus$ in circumstellar ""habitable zones"" (incident fluxes between 0.25--1.50 $F_\oplus$). The results presented here demonstrate the potential for transformative characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using $Gaia$ data.

0009-0008-8481-711X,Daniel Huber,Hochschule Aalen,Phonon-assisted two-photon interference from remote quantum emitters,1970,"  Photonic quantum technologies are on the verge of finding applications in everyday life with quantum cryptography and the quantum internet on the horizon. Extensive research has been carried out to determine suitable quantum emitters and single epitaxial quantum dots are emerging as near-optimal sources of bright, on-demand, highly indistinguishable single photons and entangled photon pairs. In order to build up quantum networks, it is now essential to interface remote quantum emitters. However, this is still an outstanding challenge, as the quantum states of dissimilar 'artificial atoms' have to be prepared on-demand with high fidelity, and the generated photons have to be made indistinguishable in all possible degrees of freedom. Here, we overcome this major obstacle and show an unprecedented two-photon interference (visibility of 51+/-5%) from remote strain-tunable GaAs quantum dots, emitting on-demand photon-pairs. We achieve this result by exploiting for the first time the full potential of the novel phonon-assisted two-photon excitation scheme, which allows for the generation of highly indistinguishable (visibility of 71+/-9%) entangled photon-pairs (fidelity of 90+/-2%), it enables push-to button biexciton state preparation (fidelity of 80+/-2%) and it outperforms conventional resonant two-photon excitation schemes in terms of robustness against environmental decoherence. Our results mark an important milestone for the practical realization of quantum repeaters and complex multi-photon entanglement experiments involving dissimilar artificial atoms.

The visibility data are consistent with a single star and exclude stellar companions at separations ~1-1000 mas (~ 0.1-113 AU) and contrasts < 3.5 magnitudes. This result supports the validation of the 1.6 R_{earth} exoplanet Kepler-21b by Howell et al. (2012) and complements the constraints set by adaptive optics imaging, speckle interferometry, and radial velocity observations to rule out false-positives due to stellar companions. We conclude that long-baseline interferometry has strong potential to validate transiting extrasolar planets, particularly for future projects aimed at brighter stars and for host stars where radial velocity follow-up is not available.

The EU has recently issued several publications emphasizing the necessity of trust in AI, underscoring the dual nature of AI as both a beneficial tool and a potential weapon. This dichotomy highlights the urgent need for international regulation. Concurrently, there is a need for frameworks that guide companies in AI development, ensuring compliance with such regulations. Our research aims to assist lawmakers and machine learning practitioners in navigating the evolving landscape of AI regulation, identifying focal areas for future attention.

In this paper, we explore Cooperative Perception (CP) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), considering the unique communication needs involving high dynamics and a large number of UAS. We propose a hybrid approach combining local broadcast with a central CP service, inspired by centrally managed U-space and broadcast mechanisms from automotive and aviation domains. In a simulation study, we show that our approach significantly enhances the environmental awareness for UAS compared to fully distributed approaches, with an increased communication channel load, which we also evaluate. These findings prompt a discussion on communication strategies for CP in UAM and the potential of a centralized CP service in future research. ",Kein DOI-Link verfügbar,2405.03290v2,Yes,potent(1)

In PRD 92, 094516 (2015) the complex Langevin method was shown to break down when the inverse coupling decreases and enters the transition region from the deconfined to the confined phase. We found that the stochastic technique used to estimate the drift term can be very unstable for indefinite matrices. This may be avoided by using the full inverse of the Dirac operator, which is, however, too costly for four-dimensional lattices. The major breakthrough in this work was achieved by realizing that the inverse elements necessary for the drift term can be computed efficiently using the selected inversion technique provided by the parallel sparse direct solver package PARDISO. In our new study we show that no breakdown of the complex Langevin method is encountered and that simulations can be performed across the phase boundary.

0000-0003-4239-8945,Olaf Schenk,MSH Medical School Hamburg Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften and Medical Universität,Level-based Blocking for Sparse Matrices: Sparse Matrix-Power-Vector   Multiplication,1970,"  The multiplication of a sparse matrix with a dense vector (SpMV) is a key component in many numerical schemes and its performance is known to be severely limited by main memory access. Several numerical schemes require the multiplication of a sparse matrix polynomial with a dense vector, which is typically implemented as a sequence of SpMVs. This results in low performance and ignores the potential to increase the arithmetic intensity by reusing the matrix data from cache. In this work we use the recursive algebraic coloring engine (RACE) to enable blocking of sparse matrix data across the polynomial computations. In the graph representing the sparse matrix we form levels using a breadth-first search. Locality relations of these levels are then used to improve spatial and temporal locality when accessing the matrix data and to implement an efficient multithreaded parallelization. Our approach is independent of the matrix structure and avoids shortcomings of existing ""blocking"" strategies in terms of hardware efficiency and parallelization overhead. We quantify the quality of our implementation using performance modelling and demonstrate speedups of up to 3$\times$ and 5$\times$ compared to an optimal SpMV-based baseline on a single multicore chip of recent Intel and AMD architectures. As a potential application, we demonstrate the benefit of our implementation for a Chebyshev time propagation scheme, representing the class of polynomial approximations to exponential integrators. Further numerical schemes which may benefit from our developments include $s$-step Krylov solvers and power clustering algorithms.

0000-0003-4239-8945,Olaf Schenk,MSH Medical School Hamburg Universität der Angewandte Wissenschaften and Medical Universität,AI Driven Near Real-time Locational Marginal Pricing Method: A   Feasibility and Robustness Study,1970,"  Accurate price predictions are essential for market participants in order to optimize their operational schedules and bidding strategies, especially in the current context where electricity prices become more volatile and less predictable using classical approaches. The Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) pricing mechanism is used in many modern power markets, where the traditional approach utilizes optimal power flow (OPF) solvers. However, for large electricity grids this process becomes prohibitively time-consuming and computationally intensive. Machine learning (ML) based predictions could provide an efficient tool for LMP prediction, especially in energy markets with intermittent sources like renewable energy. This study evaluates the performance of popular machine learning and deep learning models in predicting LMP on multiple electricity grids. The accuracy and robustness of these models in predicting LMP is assessed considering multiple scenarios. The results show that ML models can predict LMP 4-5 orders of magnitude faster than traditional OPF solvers with 5-6\% error rate, highlighting the potential of ML models in LMP prediction for large-scale power models with the assistance of hardware infrastructure like multi-core CPUs and GPUs in modern HPC clusters.
